<h1>PART I</h1>

<h2>RAMBLES IN WOMANLAND<br /><br /></h2>



<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THOUGHTS ON LIFE IN GENERAL</h3>


<p>Cupid will cause men to do many things; so will cupidity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>I like economy too much as a virtue not to loathe
it when it becomes a vice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Many virtues, when carried too far, become vices.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Envy is a vice which does not pay. If you let your
envy be apparent, you advertise your failure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Nothing is less common than common-sense.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Whenever you can, pay cash for what you buy. A
bill owing is like port wine&mdash;it generally improves by
keeping.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>There are people whose signature has no more
significance at the end of a letter of insults than it
has value at the bottom of a cheque.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The hardest thing to do in life is to make a living
dishonestly for any length of time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The harm that happens to others very seldom does
us any good, and the good that happens to them very
seldom does us any harm. People who are successful
are neither envious, jealous, nor revengeful.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Very often a man says, 'I have made a fool of myself!'
who should only accuse his father.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>A contract is a collection of clauses signed by two
honourable persons who take each other for scoundrels.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Many people make a noise for the simple reason that,
like drums, they are empty. Many others think themselves
deep who are only hollow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Never have anything to do with women in whose
houses you never see a man. You may say what you
like, but I have heard many women admit that the
presence of a man adds a great deal of respectability to
a house.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>If you cannot prevent evil, try not to see it. What
we do not know does not hurt us.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>A self-conscious man is sometimes one who is aware
of his worth; a conceited man is generally one who is
not aware of his unworthiness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Many a saint in a small provincial town is a devil
of a dog in the Metropolis. Life in small towns
is like life in glass-houses. The fear of the neighbour
is the beginning of wisdom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Great revolutions were not caused by great grievances
or even great sufferings, but by great injustices.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Revolutions, like new countries, are often started by
somewhat objectionable adventurers. When they have
been successful, steady and honest people come in.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The good diplomatist is not the one who forces
events, but the one who foresees them, and, when they
come, knows how to make the best of them. The
good diplomatist is not the one who successfully takes
people in, but the one who, when he has discovered who
are his true friends, sticks to them through thick and thin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>OH, YOU MEN!</h3>


<p>The Paris <i>Presse</i> had asked its male readers to mention
which virtue they most admire in women. Here
is the result, with the number of votes obtained by
each virtue, and truly it is not an edifying result:</p>

</table>


<p>Surely, here is food for reflections and comments.
Economy, order, and devotion head the list; chastity
and self-abnegation figure at the bottom. I should
have imagined the last two virtues would have obtained
the maximum of votes.</p>

<p>And is it not wonderful that the most beautiful trait
in a woman's character&mdash;I mean Loyalty&mdash;should be
altogether omitted from this list of twenty-one most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
characteristic virtues in women? Are we to conclude
that loyalty is a virtue for men alone, such as willpower,
magnanimity, energy, bravery, and straightforwardness?</p>

<p>And Sincerity, that most indispensable and precious
virtue, which is supposed to make the friendship of men
so valuable, is it not also a virtue that we should value
in women?</p>

<p>Do men mean to say that loyalty and sincerity
should not be or could not be expected to be found in
women? Woman must be sweet, of course, and be
economical. She must charm men and keep their house
on the principles of the strictest order. Lovely!</p>

<p>I know men who allow their wives &pound;1 a day to
keep their houses in plenty, and who spend &pound;2 every
day at their club. Whatever the husband does, however,
the wife must be faithful, and possess patience
and self-abnegation. She must be resigned, and, mind
you, always amiable and cheerful.</p>

<p>Poor dear fellow! the truth is, that when a man has
spent a jolly evening at his club with the 'boys,' it is
devilishly hard on him to come home at one or two in
the morning and to find his wife not amiable, not
cheerful, but suffering from the dumps, and, maybe,
not even patient enough to have waited for him.
Sometimes she does worse than this, the wretch! She
suffers from toothache or neuralgia. What of that?
She should be patient, resigned, amiable, and cheerful;
<i>c'est son m&eacute;tier</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, on the threshold of the twentieth century we
find man still considering woman as a pet animal or a
nice little beast of burden; sometimes as both. I
really should feel prouder of my sex if they would only
be kind enough to assert that men are not beings
inferior to monkeys and birds.</p>

<p>For monkeys have but one rule of morality for the
manners of both sexes, and birds share with their mates
the duties of nest-building and feeding the little ones.
The latter even go further. When the female bird does
her little house duties in the nursery, the male entertains
her with a song in order to keep her cheerful.</p>

<p>Marriage will be a failure as long as men are of
opinion that fidelity, patience, devotion, amiability,
cheerfulness, and self-abnegation are virtues expected of
women only; marriage will be a failure as long as it is
a firm, the two partners of which do not bring about the
same capital of qualities, as long as what is bad in the
goose is not bad in the gander.</p>

<p>Certainly I like to see in a man a more powerful will
than in a woman; I like to see more sweetness in a
woman than in a man. In other words, I like to see
certain virtues or qualities more accentuated in a man,
others more accentuated in a woman; but, so far as
fidelity, kindness, order, patience, industry, discretion,
courage, devotion, self-abnegation, wisdom, honesty,
sincerity, amiability, and loyalty are concerned, I
absolutely deny that they should be womanly
virtues only. They are virtues that a man should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
expect to find in a woman as well as a woman in a
man.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Oh, you men, most illogical creatures in the world!
You call woman a weak being, but, although you make
laws to protect children, you make none to protect
women. Nay, on that woman whom you call weak
you impose infallibility. When you strong, bearded
men get out of the path of duty you say: 'The flesh is
weak'; but when it is a woman who does there is no
indulgence, no mercy, no pity. No extenuating circumstances
are admitted.</p>

<p>What you most admire in women is chastity. If so,
how dare you leave unpunished the man who takes it
away from them? How is it that you receive him in
your club, welcome him in your house, and not uncommonly
congratulate him on his good fortune?</p>

<p>I hear you constantly complain that women are too
fond of dress, too careless of the money that you make
by the sweat of your brow, too frivolous, too fond of
pleasure, and that matrimony becomes, on that account,
more and more impossible.</p>

<p>Let me assure you that there are many young girls,
brought up by thoughtful mothers to be cheerful,
devoted, and careful wives; but, as a rule, you despise
them. You are attracted by the best dressed ones, and
you go and offer your heart to the bird with fine
feathers. You take the rose, and disdain to look at
the violet. How illogical of you to make complaints!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
You only get what you want, and, later on, what you
deserve.</p>

<p>The law, made by man, and the customs exact virtue
incarnate in woman. She is to have neither weaknesses,
senses, nor passions. Whatever her husband does, she
must be patient and resigned.</p>

<p>The laws and customs would be much wiser if,
instead of demanding infallibility of women, they were
to make women's duties and virtues easier by showing
less indulgence for men, and by declaring that, in
matrimony, the same conjugal virtues are expected
alike of men as of women.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE ROSE, THE LILY, AND THE VIOLET; OR, HOW DIFFERENT
METHODS APPEAL TO DIFFERENT WOMEN</h3>


<p>The man butterfly is the most dangerous member of
society. He is generally handsome, amiable, persuasive,
and witty. He may be in succession cheerful, light-hearted,
poetical, and sentimental.</p>

<p>If he comes to the rose, he says to her in his sweetest
voice: 'You are beautiful, and I love you tenderly,
ardently. I feel I can devote my whole life to you. If
you can love me, I can reward your love with a century
of constancy and faithfulness.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' says the rose, with an air of incredulity, 'I
know what the faithfulness of the butterfly is.'</p>

<p>'There are all sorts of butterflies,' he gently intimates;
'I know that some of them have committed
perjury and deceived roses, but I am not one of them.
Of the butterfly I have only the wings, to always bring
me back to you. I am a one-rose butterfly; if the
others are inconstant, unfaithful, liars, I am innocent of
their faults. I swear, if you will not listen to me, I
shall die, and in dying for you there will be happiness
still.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>The rose is touched, moved and charmed with this
passionate language. 'How he loves me!' she thinks.
'After all, if butterflies are generally perfidious, it is not
his fault; he is not one of that sort.'</p>

<p>The rose yields; she gives up to him her whole soul,
all her most exquisite perfume. After he is saturated,
he takes his flight.</p>

<p>'Where are you going?' asks the rose.</p>

<p>'Where am I going?' he says, with a protecting
sneer. 'Why, I am going to visit the other flowers, your
rivals.'</p>

<p>'But you swore you would be faithful to me!'</p>

<p>'I know, my dear; a butterfly's oath, nothing more.
You should have been wiser, and not allowed yourself to
be taken in.'</p>

<p>Then he goes in the neighbourhood of a beautiful,
haughty, vain lily. Meantime an ugly bumble comes
near the rose and tries to sting her. She calls the
butterfly to her help, but he does not even deign to
answer. For him the rose is the past and the lily
the present. He is no more grateful than he is
faithful.</p>


<h4>WHEN HE MEETS THE LILY</h4>

<p>With the lily, whom he understands well, he knows
he has to proceed in quite a different manner. He must
use flattery.</p>

<p>'Imagine, lovely lily,' he says to her, 'that this silly
and vain rose thinks she is the queen of flowers. She is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
beautiful, no doubt, but what is her beauty compared to
yours? What is her perfume? Almost insipid compared
to your enchanting, intoxicating fragrance.
What is her shape compared to your glorious figure?
Why, she looks like a pink cabbage. Is not, after all,
pure whiteness incomparable? My dear lady, you are
above competition.'</p>

<p>The vain lily listens with attention and pleasure.
The wily butterfly sees he is making progress. He goes
on flattering, then risks a few words of love.</p>

<p>'Ah!' sighs the lily, 'if you were not a fickle butterfly,
I might believe half of what you say!'</p>

<p>'You do not know me!' he exclaims indignantly. 'I
have only the shape of a butterfly; I have not the heart
of one. How could I be unfaithful to you if you loved
me? Are you not the most beautiful of flowers? How
could it be possible for me to prefer any other to you?
No, no; for the rest of my life there will be but the lily
for me.'</p>

<p>The vanity of the lily is flattered, she believes him,
and gives herself up to the passionate embrace of the
butterfly.</p>

<p>'Oh, beloved one,' she exclaims in ecstasy, 'you will
love me for ever; you will always be mine as I am
yours!'</p>

<p>'To tell you the truth, my dear lily,' says the butterfly
coolly, 'you are very nice, but your perfume is
rather strong, a little vulgar, and one gets tired of it
quickly. I am not sure that I do not prefer the rose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
to you. Now, be good, and let me go quickly. I am
a butterfly. I cannot help my nature; I was made like
that. Good-bye!'</p>


<h4>THE MODEST VIOLET</h4>

<p>Then he flies towards a timid violet, modestly hidden
in the ivy near the wall. Her sweet odour reveals her
presence. So he stops and says to her:</p>

<p>'Sweet, exquisite violet, how I do love you! Other
flowers may be beautiful, my darling, but that is all.
You, besides, are good and modest; as for your sweet,
delicious perfume, it is absolutely beyond competition.
I might admire a rose or a lily for a moment, lose my
head over them, but not my heart. You alone can
inspire sincere and true love. If you will marry me&mdash;for
you do not imagine that I could ask you to love me
without at the same time asking you to be my wife&mdash;we
will lead a quiet, retired life of eternal bliss, hidden in
the ivy, far from the noise and the crowd.'</p>

<p>'This would be beautiful,' says the violet, 'but I am
afraid you are too brilliant for me, and I too modest
and humble for you. I have been warned against you.
People say you are fickle.'</p>

<p>'Who could have slandered me so? Your modesty
is the very thing that has attracted me to you. I have
crossed the garden without looking at any other flower
in order to come to you straight. What I want is a
heart like yours&mdash;tender, faithful&mdash;a heart that I may
feel is mine for the rest of my days.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>And he swears his love, always promising matrimony
as soon as a few difficulties, 'over which he has no
control,' are surmounted. The poor little violet is
fascinated, won; she loves him, and gives herself to
him; but it is not long before he goes.</p>

<p>'Surely,' she says, with her eyes filled with tears, 'you
are not going to abandon me. You are not going to
leave me to fight the great big battle of life alone, with
all the other flowers of the garden to sneer at me and
despise me! Oh no, dear; I have loved you with my
modest soul; I have given you all I have in the world.
No, no, you are not going away, never to return again!
It would be too cruel! No, the world is not so bad as
that; you will return, won't you?'</p>

<p>'I feel very sorry for you, dear&mdash;really very sorry;
but, you see, I cannot. I am a gentleman, and I have
my social position to think of. I am sure you understand
that. You say you are fond of me; then you will
put yourself in my place, and conclude that I have done
the best I could for you. Good-bye! Forget me as
quickly as you can.'</p>

<p>The little violet commits suicide; and the butterfly,
reading an account of it in the following day's papers,
has not even a tear to shed, no remorse, no regret.</p>


<h4>A SHINING SOCIAL LIGHT.</h4>

<p>He is called by his club friends 'a devil of a fellow
with the girls,' and that is almost meant as a compliment.
As for the women of the very best society, he is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
thought rather enterprising and dangerous; but I have
never heard that, for his conduct, he has ever been
turned out of a respectable house or of a decent club.</p>

<p>There is one drawback to the perfect happiness of the
butterfly: he is generally in love with a worthless
woman, who makes a fool of him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>WOMEN LOVE BETTER THAN MEN</h3>


<p>How many people understand what love means? How
many appreciate it? How many ever realize what it
is? For some it is a more or less sickly sentiment, for
others merely violent desires.</p>

<p>Alas! it requires so many qualifications to appreciate
love that very few people are sufficiently free from some
vulgarity or other to be worthy of speaking of love
without profanity.</p>

<p>Love requires too much constancy to suit the light-hearted,
too much ardour to suit calm temperaments,
too much reserve to suit violent constitutions, too much
delicacy to suit people destitute of refinement, too much
enthusiasm to suit cool hearts, too much diplomacy to
suit the simple-minded, too much activity to suit indolent
characters, too many desires to suit the wise.</p>

<p>See what love requires to be properly and thoroughly
appreciated, and you will easily understand why it must
be in woman's nature to love better and longer than
man.</p>

<p>Men can worship better than women, but women can
love better than men. Of this there can be no doubt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Very often women believe that they are loved when
they are only ardently desired because they are beautiful,
piquant, elegant, rich, difficult to obtain, and because
men are violent, ambitious, wilful, and obstinate; and
the more obstacles there are in their way, the more bent
they feel on triumphing over difficulties.</p>

<p>To obtain a woman men will risk their lives, ruin
themselves, commit any act of folly or extravagance
which you care to name. Women are flattered by
these follies and extravagances due to motives of very
different characters; but they mistake passion for love.</p>

<p>Yet passion is very seldom compatible with true love.
Passion is as fickle as love is constant. Passion is but a
proof of vanity and selfishness.</p>

<p>Woman is only the pretext for the display of it.
Singers, actresses, danseuses, all women detached from
that shade and mystery in which love delights in dwelling,
women who give to the public all the treasures
of their beauty, amiability, and talent are those who
inspire in men the most violent passions, but they are
seldom truly loved unless they consent to retire from
the glare of the footlights and withdraw to the shade.</p>

<p>Passion excites vanity, noise, envy: it plays to the
gallery. Love seeks retirement, and prefers a moss
bank against some wall covered with ivy, some solitude
where silence is so perfect that two hearts can hear each
other beat, where space is so small that lips must
forcibly meet.</p>

<p>The man who takes his bride to Paris for the honeymoon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
does not really love her. If he loves truly he
will take her to the border of a forest in some secluded,
picturesque spot, where nature will act as a church in
which both will fervently worship.</p>

<p>Now, with very few exceptions, women understand
these things much better than men. They are born
with feelings of delicacy and refinement that only few
men can acquire or develop; they are more earnest,
more poetical, better diplomatists, and of temperaments
generally more artistic.</p>

<p>Besides&mdash;and it is in this that they are infinitely
superior to men&mdash;whereas many men see their love
cooled by possession, all women see theirs increased
and sealed by it.</p>

<p>The moment a woman is possessed by the man she
loves, she belongs to him body, heart, and soul. Her
love is the occupation of her life, her only thought, and,
I may add without the slightest idea of irreverence, her
religion.</p>

<p>She loves that man as she does God. If all men
could only be sufficiently impressed with this fact, how
kind and devoted to women they would be!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>IS WOMAN A RESPONSIBLE BEING?</h3>


<p>There are nations still in existence where women are
denied the possession of a soul; but these nations are
not civilized. Now, Germany and England are civilized
nations, yet I am not sure that some Germans and
Englishmen really admit that women are beings possessed
of a mind.</p>

<p>I have constantly heard Englishmen of 'the good old
school' say: 'If a man steals my horse, my dog, my
poultry, I have him arrested, and he gets a few months'
imprisonment; if he steals my wife, he remains at large,
unmolested. Yet, is not my wife my most valuable
property?' And that good Englishman is absolutely
persuaded that his argument is unanswerable.</p>

<p>The other day, in a German paper, I read the following
exquisitely delicious remark: 'We have a treaty of
extradition with Switzerland. If the man Giron had
stolen the least valuable horse of the Crown Prince of
Saxony, we could have had him arrested in Geneva and
returned to us; but as he only stole the wife of that
prince, the mother of his children, we can do nothing.'</p>

<p>From all this we are bound to conclude that, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
eyes of many Germans and some Englishmen, a woman is
like a horse or any other animal, a thing, a 'brute of no
understanding,' a being without a mind. In my ignorance
I thought that when women left their husbands to
follow other men, they were, rightly or wrongly, using
their own minds, acting on their own responsibility and
on their own good or bad judgment.</p>

<p>In other words, I thought that they were thinking
beings.</p>

<p>When a man steals a horse, he takes him by the
mane or the mouth and pulls him away with him. He
does not say to the animal, 'I like you; I will treat
you better than your master; will you come with me?'
He steals him, as he would an inanimate thing.</p>

<p>When a man asks a woman to elope with him, he
says to her: 'I love you, I know you love me; leave
your husband, who makes you unhappy, and come with
me, who will make you happy.' She reflects, and,
through feelings of despair, of love, of passion, she
yields, and answers, 'Yes, I will.'</p>

<p>Now, her resolution may be most reprehensible, her
conduct immoral; she may be a fool, anything you like,
but she is not carried off by force. She acts of her own
accord and free will, and is, I imagine, prepared to meet
the consequences of her actions.</p>

<p>I have heard an English magistrate say to a man
whose wife was accused of disorderly conduct: 'You
should look after your wife better than you do, and, in
future, I will make you responsible for what she does.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
To-day I will impose a fine of ten shillings. If you pay
it, I will set her free.'</p>

<p>Now, this argument would be fairly good if the
accused had been a dog. I should understand a magistrate
saying to a man: 'Your dog is a nuisance and a
source of danger to your neighbours; if he causes any
more damage, if I hear again that he has killed your
neighbour's cat, eaten his poultry, or bitten his children,
I will hold you responsible, and make you pay the
damages, <i>plus</i> some compensation.' But a wife!&mdash;inasmuch
that, mind you, when a woman has committed a
murder in England, it is she who is hanged, not her
husband.</p>

<p>I believe that women are quite prepared to accept the
responsibility of their actions. The emancipation of
woman should be an accomplished fact by the declaration
that she can do evil as well as good. And I am
sure that if she wants credit for whatever good she
does, she is also ready to accept the consequences of the
mischief, to herself or to others, which she may make.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>RAMBLES IN CUPID'S DOMAIN</h3>


<p>Love performs daily miracles. It causes people to see
with closed eyes, and to see nothing with open ones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Women worship sacrifice to the extent of wishing us
to believe (perhaps they believe it themselves) that, even
at the altar of love, they make a sacrifice. Women in
love have an irresistible craving for sacrifice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>I have heard of women being so much in love as to
declare to their husbands that they would not want a
new hat for another month.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The world of love can boast a roll of demi-gods,
heroes, martyrs, and saints that would put into the
shade those of Paradise and Olympus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Love, after being conquered, has to be reconquered
every day. Love is like money invested in doubtful
stock, which has to be watched at every moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Speculators know this; but married men and women
too often ignore it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>In love the hand lies much less than the lips and the
eyes. A certain pressing of the hand is often the most
respectful and surest of proofs of love.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The language of the hand is most eloquent. Who
has not been able to translate a pressure from a woman's
hand by 'stay' or 'go'? How a woman can say to
you with her hand 'I love you' or 'I cannot love you'!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Whoever says that two kisses can be perfectly alike
does not know the A B C of love.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>No two acts dictated, or even suggested, by love
should ever be alike.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>In love it is better to be a creditor than a debtor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Think of the torrents of harmony which maestros
have composed with seven notes; the millions of thoughts
which have been expressed with a score of letters; think
of all the exploits, deeds of valour, and crimes that have
been committed under the influence of love!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Love is not compatible with conceit; the love of self<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
excludes all other. Even injury cannot cure love; if it
does, there was in the person much more conceit than
love.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>When a man and a woman have pronounced together
the three sacramental words 'I love you,' they become
priest and priestess of the same temple. In order to
keep the sacred fire alive, they must be careful not to
stifle it by an excess of fuel or to let it go out for want
of air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>When you are in love, do not be over-sensitive, but
always imagine that the other is. Thus your susceptibility
will never be wounded, nor will that of your
partner be.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Woe to people in love who satisfy all their desires in
a week, in a month, in a year! Two lovers, or married
people, should die without having drunk the cup of love
to the last dregs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Absence is a tonic for love only when men and women
love with all their heart and soul. When they do not,
the ancient proverb is still true: 'Far from the eyes, far
from the heart.'</p>

<p>A beautiful woman is jealous of no woman, not even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of a George Sand, a George Eliot, or of a queen; but a
duchess may be jealous of a chambermaid.</p>

<p>All the love-letters of a woman are not worth one of
her smiles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>If a woman wants to know the secret for remaining
loved a long time, let her keep this recipe in mind:
Give much, give more still, but be sure that you do not
give all. Cupid is a little ungrateful beast, who takes
his flight when expectations cease to whet his appetite.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>For common mortals, desire engenders love, and love
kills desire; for the elect, love is the son of desire and
the prolific father of a thousand new desires.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>To conquer a man is nothing for a woman to boast
of, but to conquer a woman is a real victory, because
it requires in a man, to conquer a woman, far more
qualities than it requires in a woman to conquer a
man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>There is a touching exchange of amiable services
between the sexes. The man of twenty often receives
his first lesson in love from a woman of forty; and the
woman of twenty generally receives hers from a man of
forty.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The following are among the little tortures which
people in love take pleasure in inflicting upon themselves-:</p>

<p>'Amelia has been coughing twice to-day. I wonder
if the poor darling is consumptive? An aunt of hers
died of consumption. She was an aunt only by marriage,
but when those confounded microbes enter a family, no
one knows the mischief they may do!'</p>

<p>'George did not notice I had a carnation, his favourite
flower, on my corsage the whole of last evening. He
loves me no more.'</p>

<p>'Do I love Algy&mdash;do I adore him as he deserves?
Am I worthy of him? Shall I be able to keep the
love of a man so handsome, so kind, so clever? This
morning he did not kiss me with the same ardour.
Perhaps he has not courage enough to confess that he
does not love me as much as he used to.'</p>

<p>'I am too happy. Something tells me it cannot last.
I have a presentiment that a great misfortune is going
to happen. Our love cannot possibly enjoy such bliss
for long. I feel I am going to cry.'</p>

<p>And she bursts into hot tears.</p>

<p>'To-day Arthur met me at the appointed time to
the minute. Formerly he used to be in advance&mdash;always.
I told him so, and he said, showing me the
time by his watch, that he was quite punctual. He
ought to have been pleased with my remark, and have
answered otherwise. I wonder if there is anything
wrong?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>'He never notices my dresses as he used to. Yesterday
I changed the bow I had on, and he made no
remark. I know all his cravats, every one of them. I
also know when he has tied them before a glass, and
when he has not. He does not love me as I love him.'</p>

<p>'I am quite happy when my hands are in his, but he
is not satisfied with that; he always wants to kiss me.
He loves me with his senses, not with his heart. They
say all men are the same. I thought George was
different from all of them!'</p>

<p>'I have always heard that love is the most sublime
joy on earth. I love and I am loved; yet I want to cry,
and I don't know why. Oh, why?'</p>

<p>'Why do I find that Angelina looks better in gray
than in red? I ought to admire her in whatever colour
she has on. Should I make such a remark if my love
was intense? Was I a brute for making it before her?
She has been sad ever since. But why does she wear
red? Red does not suit a blonde. Red is for brunettes.
Yet, can I tell her that? Of course, I cannot. I must
not imagine that she does not know that herself, and
besides, I should find her beautiful in anything. I am
an ass, a silly ass!'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>WHICH SEX WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO BE?</h3>


<p>I once heard a Frenchman say, 'My wife could do
without me, but I couldn't do without her;' but, as a
rule, the Frenchman who has had the good fortune of
marrying an intelligent wife becomes so dependent on
her, so much under her influence, that no general rule
should be drawn from the remark. When a man and
wife have lived happily together, I find, from my
personal observations, that when one has gone, it is
generally the woman who can better do without the
man than the reverse.</p>

<p>Of course, the question is very complex, and one
which I would rather ask than answer. If sexes could
do one without the other, and resolved to do it for fifty
years, the world would put up its shutters. May not
the question resolve itself into the following: Of old
bachelors and old maids, which are the happier?</p>

<p>Even this question is not a fair one, because it must
be admitted that society, which is very lenient over the
peccadilloes of unmarried men, frowns unmercifully over
those of unmarried women. Shall we then say, Of old
bachelors and old maids, who have led monachal lives,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
which have been the happier, and would be the more
ready to decline matrimony if the opportunity were
again offered to them? Now, can you answer the
question more easily? Well, if you can, I can't, and
if you have anything to say on the subject I shall be
glad to hear it.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the question practically amounts
to this: Which would you rather be, a man or a
woman?</p>

<p>Now, this is a question which my readers will find
difficulty in answering, and even in speaking about, with
authority, as each of them has only had the experiences
of one sex.</p>

<p>Before answering it, we must indeed talk it over with
some very intimate and trustworthy friends of the other
sex, and compare their sentiments and sensations with
our own. We must recall to our minds all the observations
which we have made on the lives of men and
women whom we have known. Let us not follow the
example of the woman who would be a man 'because
men are free,' and the man who would be a woman
'because women are admired,' for the reason that all
men are not free, and women are far from being all
admired.</p>

<p>I have interviewed on the subject many men and
many women, and I have found an enormous majority
of women who would elect to be men, and only a very
small minority of men who would elect to be women.
Conclusion: most people would elect to be men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>I am a man, and if I were to be born again and asked
to make a choice, I would elect to be a man; but the
reason may be that I possess many failings of which I
am aware, and also a few qualities which the most imperfect
of us must necessarily possess who are not
absolute objects of perdition.</p>

<p>For let us say at once that sex suits character.</p>

<p>I love freedom and hate conventionalities; I am a
man of action, and must always be up and doing. I do
not believe that I am in any way tyrannical, yet I like
to lead and have my own way. If the position of first
fiddle is engaged, I decline to form part of the orchestra.
Most of these characteristics are failings, perhaps even
faults, but I possess them, and I cannot help possessing
them, and they naturally induce me to prefer being a
man.</p>

<p>I have made my confession, let my readers make
theirs instead of taking me to task. I hate to feel protected,
to be petted, but I would love to protect and
pet a beloved one, whom I would think weaker than
myself. I am a born fighter, and I don't care for
smooth paths, unless I can make them smooth myself
for my own use and also for the use of those who walk
through life by my side.</p>

<p>But, leaving aside personal characteristics which
would lead me to elect to be a man, there are many
reasons which would cause me to make that choice quite
independent of my character. Nature has given women
beauty of face and figure, but there she stopped, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
make her pay for that gift she has handicapped her in
every possible way.</p>

<p>And when I consider that there are in this world
more ugly women than beautiful ones, and that an ugly
woman is the abomination of desolation, an anomaly, a
freak, I altogether fail to see why ninety women out
of a hundred should return thanks for being women.
I have no hesitation in saying that the woman who is
not beautiful has no <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, and that only a few
beautiful women are happy to be alive after they are
forty.</p>

<p>Women have terrible grievances, many of which
society and legislation (that is to say, in the second
case, man) ought to redress. But the greatest grievances
of women are, to my mind, against nature. These
grievances cannot and will never be redressed.</p>

<p>In love woman has an unfair position. She gets old
when a man of the same age remains young. In every
race she is handicapped out of any chance of winning or
even getting a dead heat. For these reasons especially
I should elect to be a man.</p>

<p>Ah, what a pity we cannot decide our fate in every
phase of life! in which case I would elect to be a
beautiful woman from twenty to thirty, a brilliant
officer from thirty to forty, a celebrated painter from
forty to fifty, a famous poet or novelist from fifty to
sixty, Prime Minister of England or President of the
United States from sixty to seventy, and a Cardinal for
the rest of my life.</p>

<h3>RAMBLES IN WOMANLAND</h3>


<p>When a woman says of her husband, 'He is a wretch!'
she may still love him; probably she does. When she
says, 'Oh, he is a good sort'&mdash;poor fellow!</p>

<p>After bravery and generosity, tact and discretion
are the two qualities that women most admire in
men; audacity comes next.</p>

<p>Speaking of his wife, a Duke says, 'The Duchess';
a man standing always on ceremony, 'Mrs. B.'; a
gentleman, 'My wife'; an idiot, 'My better half'; a
common man, 'The missus'; a working man, as a
compliment, 'The old woman'; a French grocer, 'La
patronne'; a French working man, 'La bourgeoise.'
The sweet French word '&eacute;pouse' is only used now by
Paris concierges.</p>

<p>In the good old times of poetry and adventures,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
when a man was refused a girl by her parents, he
carried her off; now he asks for another. But, then,
posting exists no longer except for letters, and there is
no poetry in eloping in a railroad car. Oh, progress!
oh, civilization! such is thy handicraft! Dull,
prosaic times we are living in!</p>

<p>Woman is an angel who may become a devil, a sister
of mercy who may change into a viper, a ladybird who
may be transformed into a stinging-bee. Sometimes
she never changes, and all her lifetime remains angel,
sister of mercy, ladybird, and sweet fragrant flower.
It depends a great deal on the gardener.</p>

<p>When a man is on the wrong path in life, it is
seldom he does not meet a woman who says to him,
'Don't go that way'; but when it is a woman who
has lost her way, she always meets a man who indicates
to her the wrong path.</p>

<p>Women were not born to command, but they have
enough inborn power to govern man who commands,
and, as a rule, the best and happiest marriages are
those where women have most authority, and where
their advice is oftenest followed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>There are three ways for a man to get popular with
women. The first is to love them, the second to sympathize
with their inclinations, and the third to give
them reasons that will raise them in their own estimation.
In other words, love them, love what they love,
or cause them to love themselves better. Love, always
love.</p>

<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>A woman knows that a man is in love with her long
before he does. A woman's intuition is keener than
her sight; in fact, it is a sixth sense given to her by
nature, and which is more powerful than the other five
put together.</p>

<p>Very beautiful, as well as very good, women are

<p>A woman will often more easily resist the love which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
she feels for a man than the love which she inspires in
him. It is in the most beautiful nature of woman to
consider herself as a reward, but it is also, unfortunately
for her, too often her misfortune.</p>

<p>We admire a foreigner who gets naturalized in our
own country, and despise a compatriot who makes a
foreigner of himself. If a man joins our religion, we
call him converted; if one of ours goes over to another,
we call him perverted. In the same way, we blame the
inconstancy of a woman when she leaves us for another,
and we find her charming when she leaves another to
come to us.</p>

<p>Frivolous love may satisfy a man and a woman for a

<p>Love feeds on contrasts to such an extent that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>

woman.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of men: those who will come
across temptations and resist them, those who will avoid
them for fear of succumbing, and those who seek them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Among the first are to be found only men whose love
for a woman is the first consideration of their lives.</p>

<p>Young girls should bear in mind that husbands are
not creatures who are always making love, any more
than soldiers are men who are always fighting.</p>

<p>A love affair will interest even a very old woman,
just as the account of a race will always interest an
old jockey. Habit, you see!</p>

<p>The friendship of women for women is very often less
based on love, or even sympathy, than on little indiscreet
confidences which they may have made to one
another.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />

<p>In order that love may be lasting, it must be closely
allied with tried friendship. One cannot replace the
other, but so long as both march abreast, living
together, a man and a woman can find life delicious.</p>

<p>It is not matrimony that kills love, but the way in
which many people live in the state of matrimony.
It may be affirmed, however, that only intelligent
diplomatists (alas! the select few!) can make love
last long in matrimonial life.</p>

<p>Women who suggest to the mind notes of interrogation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
are more interesting than those, too perfect, who
only suggest notes of admiration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Constant reproaches do not kill love so quickly and
so surely as constant reminders of what one has done to
deserve gratitude. Why? Simply because Cupid loves
freedom, and lives on it. To ask for love as a debt of
gratitude is like forcing it, and the failure is fatal.</p>

<p>Women are all actresses. What makes actresses so
fascinating and attractive to men is that they are
women twice over.</p>

<p>Woman is weak and man is strong&mdash;so we constantly
hear, at any rate. Then why, in the name of common-sense,
do we expect to find in women virtues that
demand a strength of which we men are not capable?</p>

<p>Love is a divine law; duty is only a human&mdash;nay,
only a social&mdash;one. That is why love will always
triumph over duty; it is the greater of the two.</p>

<p>Lovers are very much like thieves; they proceed very
much in the same way, and the same fate eventually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>

then by degrees they neglect them, until they forget to
take the necessary ones, and they are caught.</p>

<p>A man who has been married enters the kingdom of

<p>A woman who marries a second time runs two risks:
she may regret that she lost her first husband, or that
she did not always have the second one. But, in the

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>WOMEN AND THEIR WAYS</h3>


<p>I sometimes wonder how some women dare go out when
it is windy. Their hats are fixed to their hair by
means of long pins; their hair is fixed to their heads by
means of short ones, and sometimes it happens that
their heads are fixed to their shoulders by the most
delicate of contrivances.  Yes, it is wonderful!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Fiction is full of Kings and Princes marrying shepherdesses
and beggar-maids; but in reality it is only
the Grand-Ducal House of Tuscany, which for nearly
three hundred years has exhibited royal Princesses
running away with dancing masters and French masters
engaged at their husbands' courts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />

<p>A man in love is always interesting. What a pity it
is that husbands cannot always be in love!</p>

<p>Men who always praise women do not know them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
well; men who always speak ill of them do not know
them at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>What particularly flatters the vanity of women is to
know that some men love them and dare not tell
them so. However, they do not always insist on those
men remaining silent for ever.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />

<p>The saddest spectacle that the world can offer is
that of a sweet, sensible, intelligent woman married
to a conceited, tyrannical fool.</p>

<p>The fidelity of a man to the woman he loves is not a
duty, but almost an act of selfishness. It is for his own
sake still more than for hers that he should be faithful

<p>I know handsome men who are bald, and there are
not a few, but many, who derive distinction from this
baldness. There are men&mdash;severe, stern types of men&mdash;who
are not disfigured, but improved, by spectacles.
Just imagine, if you can, the possibility of a bald woman
with spectacles inspiring a tender passion! So much
for the infallibility of the proverb, 'What's sauce for
the goose is sauce for the gander,' so often quoted by
women when they are told that men can afford to do
this or that, but not they. Lady women-righters, please
answer.</p>

<p>In the tender relations between men and women,
novelty is a wonderful attraction, and habit a powerful
bond; but between the two there is a bottomless precipice
into which love often falls, never to be heard of
afterward. Happy those who know how to bridge over
the chasm!</p>

<p>A woman never forgets, however old she may be, that
she was once very beautiful. Why should she? The
pity is that she very often forgets that she is so no
longer. My pet aversion in society is the woman of
sixty who succeeds in making herself look fifty, thinks
she is forty, acts as if she were thirty, and dresses as if
she were twenty.</p>

<p>I am not prepared to say that celibacy is preferable

over it: a bachelor can always cease to be one the

<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />

<p>Women are extremists in everything. Poets, painters
and sculptors know this so well that they have always
taken women as models for War, Pestilence, Death,
Famine and Justice, Virtue, Glory, Victory, Pity,
Charity. On the other hand, virtues and vices, blessings
and calamities of a lesser degree are represented
by men. Such are Work, Perseverance, Laziness,
Avarice, etc.</p>

<p>It is not given to any man or woman to fall in love
more than once with the same person. And although
men and women may love several times in succession,
they can only once love to the fulness of their hearts.</p>

<p>Love does to women what the sun does to flowers: it
colours them, embellishes them, makes them look
radiant and beautiful; but when it is too ardent it
consumes and withers them.</p>

<p>There are two terribly embarrassing moments in the

he does not really love her.</p>

<p>It is a mistake for a married couple to consider that
marriage has made them one. To be attractive to each
other they should each preserve their personality
quite distinct. Marriage is very often dull because
man and wife are one, and feel lonely. Most people
get bored in their own company.</p>

<p>Happiness in matrimony is sober, serious, based on
love, confidence, and friendship. Those who seek in

<p>On the part of a husband, violent jealousy is an
insult to his wife, but delicate, discreet jealousy is
almost a compliment to her, for it proves his lack of

<p>Most women have the hearts of poets and the minds

<p>Love in matrimony can live only on condition that
man and wife remain interesting in each other's eyes.
Devotion, fidelity, attention to duty, and all the troop

alive.</p>

<p>Beauty is not the mother of Love. On the contrary,
it is often love which engenders beauty, gives brilliancy
to the eyes, gracefulness to the body, vibration to the
voice. Love is the sun that hatches the flowers of
the soul. The face which reflects all the inner sentiments
of the heart betrays the love of its owner, and is
beautiful.</p>

former of their hearts, the latter of their vanity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>

rehearsing. Fortunate are those who retain for the
play the same company they had engaged for the

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>WOMAN'S MISSION IN THIS WORLD</h3>


<p>Naturalists make little difference between women and
the other females of the animal kingdom: they declare
that the mission of woman is to be a mother. Napoleon
I., who was a naturalist, being asked to give a
definition of the best woman, answered: 'The one who
bears most children.' And as for him man was mere
'cannon flesh,' I am surprised he did not say, 'The one
who bears most boys.'</p>

<p>Moralists are kinder to women; they go so far as to
grant that woman's mission is twofold: that she is
intended to be a wife and a mother; that she is to be
the guardian of the hearth, submissive and devoted to
man, her lord and master; to look after her household,
and be absorbed by her duties toward her husband
and children.</p>

<p>No sinecure, this mission of woman, as you see&mdash;no
joke either; but moralists have no sense of humour&mdash;not
a particle of it.</p>

<p>No doubt this double r&ocirc;le of wife and mother is most
respectable; it is even sacred; but woman's nature
demands something else.  To restrict her circle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
activity and influence to her family is to misappreciate
her many faculties, her aspirations, her feelings, which,
like those of men, are entitled to respect; it amounts to
not recognising that her mission is not only familial,
but social also.</p>

<p>I will not dwell on the part she is called upon to play
in the family as wife and mother. We men all know it,
whether we are husbands or sons; but we have also to
consider what the r&ocirc;le of woman is in that society of
which she is the great civilizing element as well as the
greatest ornament.</p>

<p>The most noble part that has been allotted to woman
is that of the flower in the vegetable kingdom. This
r&ocirc;le consists in throwing a spell over the world, in
making life more refined and poetical&mdash;in a word, in
spreading fragrance around her and imparting it to all
who come in contact with her. A wag once said that
but for the women men could have hoped for Paradise.
Good! But what about this world? Is not woman
the direct or indirect motive for all our actions? Is
she not the embodiment of the beautiful, and therefore
the mother of Art?</p>

<p>If she is sometimes the cause of a crime, is she not
always the cause of the most heroic deeds performed by
man? Can we for a moment suppose society without
her? Why, without her it would fall into a state of
indolence and degradation, even of utter abjection.
Would life be worth living without the sweet presence
of kind, cheerful, and amiable women?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah, my dear sir, make fun of woman in your club as
much as you like; crack jokes at her expense to your
heart's content; but acknowledge frankly that you are
under her power&mdash;at least, I hope, under her influence&mdash;and
that you could no more do without her than
without the air which enables you to breathe.</p>

<p>Talk of woman's mission as wife and mother, as
naturalists and moralists do, but let all of us artists
cry at the top of our voices that woman's mission is to
make life beautiful by the cultivation of her own
beauty, beauty of body, mind, and heart.</p>

<p>It is the duty of woman to look as beautiful as she
can; it is her imperious duty to charm the world by
her sweetness and amiability. A woman who neglects
this duty is guilty toward her fellow-creatures, even
guilty toward her Maker, by not helping the destiny
for which she was created. Countries are civilized in
proportion to the influence that women have over men
in them.</p>

<p>As long as gardens have flowers and the world has
beautiful and amiable women, so long will life be worth
living.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>IS WOMAN INFERIOR TO MAN?</h3>


<p>Many, many years ago a great council was held to
discuss the question whether women had souls. I forget
the conclusion which that learned assembly arrived at;
but what is certain is that now most men do believe
that women have souls, although a great number of
them are still of opinion that woman is a being inferior
to man.</p>

<p>They hold that man is the lord of creation, the
masterpiece, the last word of the Almighty.</p>

<p>Now, is this really the case? First, God made the
earth, then light, after which He created fishes, birds,
and animals of all sorts. Then He said: 'I will now
create a being far above all the other animals.'</p>

<p>He took some mud; mark well, I say, some mud, and
made Adam. In His wisdom He thought that mud
was not good enough to make woman out of, and for
her creation he took matter which had already been
purified by His Divine breath, and He took part of
Adam, and out of it made Eve.</p>

<p>Now, surely, my dear fellow-men, you must own that
either mud is better stuff than yourself, or you must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
confess that woman has a nobler origin than you. You
can't get out of it.</p>

<p>Please notice the order of creation: Fish, birds,
animals, man and woman. If men do not admit that
the Creator began by the least and finished with the
best, they will have to conclude that lobsters, eels,
crocodiles, sharks, owls, vultures, and mere sparrows are
beings superior to them.</p>

<p>If men do not recognise the superiority of these
animals over them, they will have to come to the conclusion
that the work of creation is one of improvement
every day.</p>

<p>But man will say, woman is not so strong as we are.
True enough; but horses are stronger than men;
elephants by trampling on them can make marmalade
of them. Stags are swifter than men. Camels can
carry a weight of 2,500 lb. on their backs. Birds can
fly, and men are only trying machines to help them
do it.</p>

<p>Is man more intelligent than woman? Certainly not.
Who ate the apple? I know that Eve was the first to
be disobedient, but she had an idea, at all events before
Adam had one.</p>

<p>Had he even the power of resistance? No. Did he
even try to shield woman after the offence was committed?
No, he didn't, the coward. He turned
against her and accused her of being the cause of the
whole evil done. Poor beginning, a poor show, and a
sad lesson by which men have profited, and to this day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
they turn against the woman they have deceived, and
often abandon her. Man is still true to his origin.</p>

<p>My dear sirs, the proof that God was satisfied that,
in creating woman, He had said the last word of His
Divine work, is that He entrusted her with the most
noble of missions, that of bearing the future generations,
of bringing children to the world, of guiding
their first steps, of cultivating their minds and inculcating
in them the love of what is good and right. In
intending woman to be mother, God proclaimed the
superiority of women over the rest of the creation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>WOMEN WHO ARE FOLLOWED AND ANNOYED IN THE STREET</h3>


<p>I have constantly heard women complain, in Paris, in
London, and in New York, that they can seldom go out
in the street without being followed and annoyed by
men, many of whom look like gentlemen.</p>

<p>And they express their complaint in tones of indignation
not altogether free from a little air of self-satisfaction
that seems to say: 'Of course a pretty woman
like myself is bound to be noticed and stared at by
men.'</p>

<p>Well, I hate to say anything unpleasant to women,
but there is an illusion in which they too often indulge,
and which I should like to dispel at once.</p>

<p>There are women beautiful as they can be, who can
walk in every city perfectly unmolested and in perfect
comfort and security, and who would be unable to
tell you whether any man or woman had noticed
them.</p>

<p>We men are not so bold as many women believe, nor
are we so silly. We have instinct, and we know pretty
well the woman who enjoys being noticed and looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
at, and even the one who seeks that enjoyment for
purpose of self-satisfaction or vanity.</p>

<p>I am over fifty years old, and any girl of twenty, I
guarantee, will make me feel as timid as she likes in her
presence, not by words, but simply by her attitude of
dignity and reserve.</p>

<p>And I believe that practically the same might be said
of every man who is not an unmitigated scoundrel or
blackguard.</p>

<p>In a word, I should like to prove that a woman, who
is too often noticed and followed in the street, should
be offended by it, and have enough conscience of her
value to mention it as little as possible; she should also
exercise more control over herself and pay great attention
to the way she dresses, looks and walks when out
in the street.</p>

<p>For if she is constantly followed, take it for granted
that there is in her appearance something, just a little
something, that gives a wrong impression of her.</p>

<p>Let women have simplicity in their toilette, dignity
in their manner, a severe gracefulness in their general
attitude, and I guarantee you that no man&mdash;I mean no
fairly well-bred man&mdash;will ever turn round to look at
them.</p>

<p>Women should not call it success. They should feel
humiliated to see that some gloriously beautiful women
do not obtain it. They should take advice and seek a
remedy with the earnestness of that cashier who, returning
home, could not even take notice of his wife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and children, much less kiss them, until he had discovered
the cause of an error of a penny in his
accounts amounting to several thousands of pounds.</p>

<p>When a woman tells me that she cannot go out without
men looking and smiling at her, I have always a
mind to say to her: 'Perhaps you wink at them.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>DANGEROUS MEN</h3>

<h3>(A WARNING TO WOMEN)</h3>


<p>Among the men who are the most dangerous for women
must be reckoned those whose advances of love generally
prove unsuccessful. Women have no idea of the
harm that may be done to them by those parasites of
their homes.</p>

<p>A woman, young, amiable, and cheerful, welcomes
such men in her house without entertaining any suspicion.
She invites them to her receptions, her dinner-parties;
she often finds them pleasant, witty, and then
they venture a few flattering compliments. She at first
accepts them as the current coin of society, and pays no
attention to them.</p>

<p>As she is amiable to her guests, she is not on her
guard, and she treats them to the same smiles, which
these fops of the purest water often imagine are gracious
smiles conferred on them only. Thus encouraged, they
go further, and venture compliments bordering on
declarations of love, or, at any rate, on expressions of
deep admiration. The young woman, used to compliments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
takes no notice of our heroes, or pretends to have
understood nothing.</p>

<p>Her silence is then taken for a tacit acceptance, and
the fops, emboldened, make an open declaration of love.
Now, a regular flirt or coquette knows how to encourage
or discourage a man with one glance, but a perfectly
good woman is taken unaware; she feels embarrassed,
and, thus apparently encouraged, these men get bolder
and bolder, until the young woman has to show them
the door.</p>

<p>Then her troubles begin. These parasites will go to
their clubs, and, even in drawing-rooms, say that she is
a heartless coquette who encourages men to make love
to her just to amuse herself. They abuse her, watch
her, and, if one day she should compromise herself in
the least, woe to her if the secret should fall into such
men's hands! There is no revenge of which they are
not capable. A case of this sort was, not long ago,
investigated thoroughly, and it turned out that an
anonymous letter had been written to the husband of a
most charming society woman by a cur whom she had
to turn out of her house for offering her a worthless
love.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>THE MAN WHO SMILES</h3>


<p>There is to be met in society a man who is particularly
provoking and supremely objectionable and offensive.
He is about forty, very gentlemanly, self-possessed,
irreproachably dressed, well informed, interesting talker,
with a somewhat patronizing air, and an eternal smile
of self-satisfaction on his face.</p>

<p>This man has compromised more women than many
a 'devil of a fellow.' If you say before him, 'Mrs.
X. is very beautiful, isn't she?' he says nothing, but
smiles complacently. So you look at him and add:</p>

<p>'Oh, you know her, then?' He smiles again. 'You
don't say so!' you remark. 'I should have thought
her a woman above the breath of suspicion.'</p>

<p>He smiles still. You become persuaded that he is,
or has been, on the most intimate terms with the lady
in question.</p>

<p>Mention before him the name of any woman you like
to choose, and if the woman is in the least fashionable,
or renowned for her beauty or position, he smiles.</p>

<p>If at a ball he asks a lady to give him the pleasure
of her partnership for a waltz or a polka, he leans close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
toward her, smiling at her in such a strange way that
people believe he is telling her words of love, or, worse,
that he is granted permission to do so.</p>

<p>If he calls on a lady on her reception day, he has a
way to salute her, to kiss her hand, to look at her in
a patronizing way that seems to say to the other
callers:</p>

<p>'See how ceremonious I am with her before other
people, and what a good comedian I am!'</p>

<p>And he smiles, smiles, and smiles.</p>

<p>Women are ill at ease in his presence. They hate
him, but as he is content with smiling, and goes no
further, what are they to do? They avoid him when
they can, his smiles are so compromising.</p>

<p>And they are right. His smiles are more compromising
than <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> slander and calumny.</p>

<p>The men hate him, too, but they feel as powerless as
the women do. They would like to slap his face, but
you cannot say to a man:</p>

<p>'I slap your face because I saw you smile on hearing
my wife's name.'</p>

<p>No, that would be too absurd. He knows it, and
that is why he goes on smiling. He is safe.</p>

<p>When he hears a bit of gossip on a woman, he
immediately takes her defence, but in such a weak
manner, and with such a smile on his face all the time,
that people immediately come to the conclusion that
'it must be all true.'</p>

<p>What is most provoking is that the man has not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
bad reputation. He has never been openly mixed in
any intrigue, and even his intimate friends have never
heard of any love affair connecting him with any woman.
For some people he is an enigma, for others a clever
comedian, a maniac, a bore, or a fop.</p>

<p>For men who justly hold that women should be
treated with such respect that no act of man should
cause anyone to even breathe a light remark on their
character, the man who smiles is a cur.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>WOMEN AND DOLLS</h3>


<p>The love of little girls for their dolls is a very serious
love; it absolutely amounts to maternal tenderness. I
have watched little girls nurse their dolls, and detected
in their eyes that almost divine glance that you can see
in devoted mothers tending their little children. For
that matter a little girl is only a woman in miniature.
A young boy has none, or very few, of the characteristics
of a man; but a young girl has, at ten years of age,
all the characteristics of a woman.</p>

<p>I have known little girls of ten and twelve who were
perfect flirts, little coquettes, careful housekeepers, and,
toward their dolls, most devoted mothers. I remember
one who sternly refused to accompany us to a most
tempting party, because her doll had a cold and she
felt she must stay at home to nurse it. She was absolutely
serious over it, and found even great delight in
remaining at home all the time by the bedside of her
doll. I remember another who had spent the whole
morning cleaning her doll's house from top to bottom.
When it was all over she drew a great sigh of relief.
'At last,' she said, 'the house is clean; that's comfort,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
anyway.' A good, dutiful, bourgeois housewife would
not have expressed herself otherwise. Have you not,
some of you, even seen little girls give medicines to
their dolls, rock them to sleep, put them to bed, tuck
them in most carefully, and see that the bedclothes did
not choke them and cause them to have nightmares?
I have, many times.</p>

<p>A man very often shows inclinations, tastes, and all
sorts of characteristic traits which his parents never discovered
in him when he was a young boy; but a woman
of thirty is what she was when she was ten, only a little
more so. A bad boy may become a very good man,
and I have known very good boys become very bad
men; but a caressing, loving little girl will surely make
a loving wife and a tender mother; a cold and uncaressing
little girl will become a heartless woman, an
indifferent wife and mother. A boy is a boy! a little
girl is a little woman.</p>

<p>This is so true that women, many women at all events,
who treated their dolls as if they were children, treat
their children as if they were dolls. It is the survival
of the little girl in the woman. I have known women
allow the hair of their boys to fall down their backs in
long curls because they looked prettier and more like
dolls, although they must have known that the sap of
their young bodies was feeding hair at the expense of
other far more important parts of their anatomy.
When you see a woman most attentive to her baby, insisting
on washing it, dressing it herself, you say: 'She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
is a most dutiful mother; she would trust no one but
herself to attend her little child.' But it is not only
the satisfaction of a duty performed that makes that
woman look so happy, it is also the pleasure she derives
from it. And the odds are ten to one that this very
woman will play at doll with her child a great deal too
long, and that the day on which she will be compelled
to allow the child to have some liberty and become
independent of her, she will resent it.</p>

<p>There is not, I believe, a single elderly woman that
does not prefer the child of her daughter to her
daughter herself, who has become now an unmanageable
doll who dresses and undresses without the help of
anybody. And if this daughter does not allow her
mother to do with the grandchild just as she likes, there
will be trouble, caused by jealousy. There will be two
women now to play at dolls. Why does a grandmother
indulge a young child, give it sweets and candies? Is
it to give that child a good digestion? No; it is to
play at dolls. Do they dress little girls like the
'principal boys' of pantomimes in the palace scene, in
order to make them acquire modest tastes and sensible
notions? No; it is to play at dolls.</p>

<p>Woman plays at dolls to the end of her life, with her
toys, with her children, with her grandchildren, and
with herself.</p>

<p>I have never heard women have a good word to say
of daughters-in-law who had not given children to their
sons. Poor, dear old ladies! They certainly were under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the impression that their sons had only one object in
view when they contemplated matrimony, that of presenting
'Grannie' with dolls to play with. I quite
understand that grandmothers should be admired, that
children should bless them, and even advise other children
to 'get some,' when they have not got any, but I
do not think that grandmothers should be held up to
the world as models, because more than nine times out
of ten they spoil children, and derive pleasure not from
duties performed to the child, but from the satisfaction
of playing at dolls. I have very often met sensible
mothers, but grandmothers seldom; they generally are
incorrigible sinners&mdash;and proud of it, too.</p>

<p>Alphonse Karr, in his 'Reminiscences,' relates how he
used to meet in society a young and charming woman
who always behaved towards him in a very cool manner.
Unable to understand the reason, he one day took a
chair by her side, made himself particularly pleasant,
and point-blank asked her why she did not seem pleased
to meet him, and inquired whether he might have
unconsciously done anything to cause her displeasure.
For a long time she defended herself, assuring him that
her coldness towards him was only in his imagination;
but, as he insisted, she at last said to him: 'Well, I
will tell you. It was thirty-five years ago. One afternoon
you called on us, and I was in the drawing-room.
Being invited to take a seat by my mother, you chose
an arm-chair on which my doll was asleep. You
removed it, and quite unceremoniously laid it on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
table, head downwards, at the risk of hurting it. In
fact, you damaged its nose. I conceived for you a
perfect hatred, and, upon my word, I do not think
that I am now capable of forgiving you altogether.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moral.</span>&mdash;If you want to get into the good graces
of a woman, praise her baby; if you want a little girl
to love you, admire her dolls and treat them with
respect.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>MEN AS A RULE ARE SELFISH&mdash;TWO KINDS OF SELFISH
MEN</h3>


<p>There are in the world men who are devotion and self-abnegation
personified; there are women who are the
embodiment of selfishness. From this we cannot lay
down a rule any more than we could if, in landing in
New York, we saw a red-haired woman, and said at
once:</p>

<p>'The Americans are a red-haired people.'</p>

<p>But as, during my life, I have known more men who
are selfish than unselfish, and more women who are unselfish
than selfish, I am prepared to conclude that man
is more selfish than woman.</p>

<p>I have known men of small income (and in their way
good men they were) belong to two or three clubs, dine
at expensive restaurants, and smoke excellent cigars all
day long.</p>

<p>Their daughters had to give lessons in order to
obtain the money that was necessary for dressing
decently, and the house had to be kept on most
economical lines.</p>

<p>I have known others, not worse than those I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
just mentioned, allow nothing but water on their family
table, and take champagne for dinner at the club or
the restaurant.</p>

<p>I could divide selfish men into two classes: the man
with good redeeming features, and the execrably selfish
man.</p>

<p>The former is good-hearted and fairly sensitive. He
hates nobody, because hatred disturbs sleep and rest.
He avoids emotions for his own comfort; he is learnedly
selfish.</p>

<p>If you are unhappy, in distressed circumstances,
don't bother him about it. He is sorry, he cannot help
it, and he would rather not hear of it.</p>

<p>If you are ill, do not expect a visit from him; the
sight of pain or grief affects him. If you are in want,
he may send you a &pound;5 note, but he does not want to
see you. He seeks the company of cheerful and happy
people only.</p>

<p>He has an income of &pound;6,000 a year, and will tell
you that nobody dies of starvation except in novels.</p>

<p>He turns his head from wretches shivering with cold
in the street, and is of opinion that a good Government
should suppress paupers and all sorts of people who
disturb the peace and happiness of the rich. His
friends call him 'a good fellow.'</p>

<p>The other type is execrable. The miseries of other
people increase his happiness. When he sees a starving-looking
man or a sick one, he returns thanks that he is
rich and healthy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>He does not avoid the unfortunate: he almost seeks
them. The more horrible tales you tell him of poverty,
sorrows, disease, wretchedness, the happier he is to feel
that he runs no danger of ever encountering such
calamities.</p>

<p>Well wrapped up in furs in a good carriage, the sight
of a beggar, benumbed with cold, sitting on the stone
steps of an empty house, doubles his comfort. He
finds his carriage better suspended, and his furs
warmer.</p>

<p>He almost believes that the abject poor were invented
to make him appreciate his good fortune better. He
is not unlike those fanatics of a certain school who
believe that the greatest bliss reserved for the elect in
heaven is to see their less fortunate brethren burn in
hell. As I have said, this type of selfish man is
execrable.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES</h3>

<h3>THE RIGHT AND WRONG IN THE CASE OF A ROYAL PRINCESS</h3>


<p>Since the escapade of the Royal Princess of Saxony
with the French tutor Giron, many have asked me,
'Do you approve or forgive her? Do you not think
that a woman who can no longer endure life with a
sullen and unsympathetic husband has a right to break
away from the social conventionalities of life and go her
own way in search of happiness?'</p>

<p>The question is not easy to answer. There may be,
or there may not be, extenuating circumstances in the
conduct of a woman who deserts her husband, or a man
who leaves his wife.</p>

<p>First of all, let me say that I place the consideration
of duty far higher than that of personal happiness.
Therefore, a man or a woman who abandons a home
where there are children of a tender age, children who
require the protection of a father and the affection of
a mother, which no one can replace, is a coward that
should be placed under the ban of society.</p>

<p>I don't care how much a woman may fall in love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
with a man, or a man with a woman, the duty of either
is to remain by the side of their children, to watch over
their education, and to see them launched in life. If
they shirk this duty, there is no excuse, no atonement
for their conduct, which closely borders on
crime.</p>

<p>When there are no children, I admit that there may
be circumstances in which I would forgive a man or a
woman who leaves a home in which life has become
unendurable, in order to seek happiness in the company
of a partner who has given proof of love, devotion, and
disinterestedness. I might also be prepared to forgive
if the children were grown up and able to support themselves.</p>

<p>On no account, however, could I approve, or even
forgive, a man who leaves a wife with whom life may
have become as intolerable as you like without duly
providing for her comfort, even if by so doing he should
have nothing left for himself, and be obliged to start
life afresh.</p>

<p>I do not admit that anyone, man or woman, has
a right to shirk responsibilities imposed by solemn
promises. Let them set this right first of all. After
that, let them solve the problem of happiness as best
they can.</p>

<p>No doubt there are drawbacks in holding royal
honours, but I believe in the old motto, <i>Noblesse
oblige</i>; and if <i>noblesse</i> does, surely royalty should.
Royalty nowadays is not of much use, except when it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
gives to the people over which it rules the example of
all virtues, of all domestic virtues especially.</p>

<p>When people are born in the purple, they are born
with responsibilities. If they fling them to the four
winds of the earth, there is no use for royalty: the
reason for its existence has ceased to exist.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>AMERICAN WOMEN IN PARIS</h3>


<p>Every year in Paris, in springtime, we see the American
women reappear with the regularity of the swallow.
We expect them, we watch for their arrival, and we
are delighted when we hear them say, with their singing
voices, that they have come for our season, which
begins in April and goes on till 'The Grand Prix' is
run during the second week of June.</p>

<p>The American woman is not only received, but
eagerly sought in our most aristocratic society. Her
amiability and brilliancy have forced open the doors of
our most exclusive mansions. She affords so much
pleasure that she is indispensable. We are dull without
her, because she is not only beautiful and a feast
for the eyes, but she is bright, brilliant, witty, unconventional,
and a feast for the mind. It is thanks to
all these qualities, far more than to her dollars, that
the American woman is to-day part and parcel of what
is called 'Tout Paris.' And, indeed, there is no woman
in the world so attractive as the fair daughter of Uncle
Sam. Her physical, moral, and intellectual charms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
make her the most interesting woman one may wish to
meet.</p>

<p>The English woman is very often beautiful. Her
freshness is exquisite, her figure excellent when she
knows how to enhance its beauty by well-made garments.
She is, perhaps, beyond competition when she
is really beautiful, but her beauty is too often statuesque,
and lacks lustre and piquancy. The French
woman is supple and graceful, but she is more fascinating
by her manner, by her chic, than by the beauty of
her complexion, the regularity of her features, and the
proportions of her figure. The German is often fine,
but generally heavy, compact, and lacking elegance.</p>

<p>The American woman is an altogether. She has the
piquancy, the fascinating manner, the elegance, the
grace, and the gait of the Parisienne; but, besides, she
often possesses the eyes of a Spaniard, the proud figure
of a Roman, and the delicate features of an English
woman. If, during the Paris season, you walk in the
Champs-Elys&eacute;es district, where all the best Americans
are settled, you will admire those women looking
radiant with intelligence, cheerful, independent, who,
you can see, have the consciousness of their value.</p>

<p>The education which she has received has developed
all her faculties. The liberty she always enjoyed, the
constant attentions she has received from father,
brother, husband, and all her male friends, have made
her feel safe everywhere, and she goes about freely,
with a firm step that stamps her American. Thanks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
to her finesse, her power of observation, her native
adaptability, she can fit herself for every station of life.
If one day she finds herself mistress of the White
House or Vice-Queen of India, she immediately feels
at home. She may be ever so learned, she is never a
pedant. She is, and remains, a woman in whose company
a man feels at once at his ease; a sort of fascinating
good fellow, with all the best attributes of womanhood;
a little of a coquette, with a suspicion of a touch
of blue-stocking&mdash;but so little. She loves dresses, and
none puts them on better than she does. English
women, even the most elegant ones at home, seldom
favour us, when they visit us, but with all the worst
frumps and frippery they can find in their wardrobe.
The American women are considerate enough to try
and do their best for us, and we appreciate the compliment.
And thus they brighten our theatres, our promenades,
our balls and dinner-parties, our fashionable
restaurants, and Paris, which loves them, could not now
do without them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>WOMEN WHO WALK BEST</h3>


<p>A few weeks ago I was watching the church parade in
Hyde Park, London, between the statue of Achilles and
Stanhope Gate, when I met an American lady of my
acquaintance. We walked together for awhile, and
then sat down in order to watch the fashionable crowd
more closely.</p>

<p>It is said that, although Americans and Englishmen
think a great deal of one another nowadays, you seldom
hear American women praise the women of England,
and more seldom still hear English women say a good
word of American women.</p>

<p>So I was tickled to know what my American lady
friend thought of the crowd that was performing before
us, and I asked her to give me her impressions.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said, 'it is as good as, if not better than,
anything that New York could produce. Possibly on
some special occasion Fifth Avenue might turn out a
few lovelier dresses, but the London average is above
the New York average. You see fewer absolute failures
here among the women, while the men are quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
unapproachable&mdash;surely Londoners are the best-dressed
men in the world.'</p>

<p>'And the New Yorkers the most brand-newly dressed
men,' I interrupted. 'But you are right. I like to
think that a coat has been worn just more than once.
But please go on.'</p>

<p>'The days when the London girl was really badly
dressed are dead and gone. We have educated her, we
Americans, until she has all but reached our standard.
Just think what the London shops were fifteen and even
ten years ago! Something awful! But now I can buy
in them everything I want just as easily as though I
were in Paris or New York.</p>

<p>'I don't know whether the supply of pretty dresses
and dainty <i>et ceteras</i> made the demand, or whether it
was the other way about, but, at any rate, there has
been a change within the last decade that is almost a
revolution. The London woman of to-day dresses quite
as well as her sister across the Channel or the Atlantic.'</p>

<p>I was getting sadly disappointed, for my lady friend
is a critic and a wit, and I was expecting a few amusing
remarks on English women. So I ventured:</p>

<p>'So you think that now English women can obtain
in London dresses just as pretty as women can in Paris
and New York?</p>

<p>'Certainly,' she replied. 'Yet they never look so
well, because, you see, when they get these pretty
dresses, these poor English women don't know how to
put them on. The English girl's education is not yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
completed. She has not learned how to carry herself
as we have in America, both at home and at school.
You know the splendid air and prima donna effects
that American women can bring off when they choose.
These young English women have hardly a suspicion of
them.</p>

<p>'In taste for the delicate things of dress the Londoner
is now just about where she should be; but she has not
yet learned how to wear a dress. A French woman or
an American would make fifty per cent, more of it than
the English woman knows how to do; and if this is to
be remedied, English girls will first have to be taught
how to walk and how to hold themselves.'</p>

<p>And no doubt my American friend had hit on the
national defect of English women&mdash;their bad way of
walking and holding themselves.</p>

<p>One's thoughts naturally fly to Spain, where every
member of the feminine sex, from the little girl of four
to the old woman, who in England would be bent and
tottering, knows how to carry herself as if she were a
queen.</p>

<p>If it is true that this result is achieved by the Spanish
custom of carrying everything on the head instead of on
the back or in the hand, it is a pity the English do not
make their girls begin at once to carry their school-satchels
in a way that will make them hold their heads
up instead of down, and accentuate gracefully their lines
both behind and in front.</p>

<p>When I was in South Africa I invariably admired the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
manner in which the Kaffir and Zulu women walked and
held themselves. On watching them I often exclaimed:
'If English women could only walk and carry themselves
as these women do, with their pretty faces and
figures, with their beautiful skin and complexion, they
would have few rivals in the world.'</p>

<p>It is by walking barefooted and carrying everything
on their heads that the women of Kaffirland and Zululand
learn to walk so well, to hold their heads up, to
bring their chests forward, to throw back their shoulders,
and give to their gait that gentle swing which is so
dainty and graceful.</p>

<p>American women obtain the same result by being
drilled at school, for it is incontestable, and, I believe,
incontested, that they are the best walking women, and
also those who, with the Parisiennes, know best how to
put on their dresses.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>WOMEN LIVE LONGER THAN MEN</h3>


<p>Heller, who has collected the greatest number of instances
of extreme long life, found 1,000 persons who
lived from 100 to 110, 60 from 110 to 120, 30 from 120
to 130, 15 from 130 to 140, 6 from 140 to 150, and one
who lived to be 169 years of age.</p>

<p>French writes that from 1881 to 1890, in Massachusetts,
there were 203 deaths of persons past the age of
100. Of these 153 were women and 50 were men.
Let us add that the parts of the world which have supplied,
in proportion to their population, the greatest
number of centenarians, are New England, Scotland, and
Brittany.</p>

<p>All these centenarians, without exception, have been
found among the humbler classes, and most of them
among peasants&mdash;that is to say, among the workers of
the community who lead quiet, regular, and busy lives.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that just those very principles
which were laid down by the Founder of the Christian
religion as best for the eternal welfare of the soul have
been proved by the passing years to be best for the
body also.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not those who are clad in purple and fine linen
and fare sumptuously every day who are strong enough
to climb to the clear heights of a great age. Neither
titles nor wealth keep the feet from wearying of the
uphill path of life.</p>

<p>They who would have their days long in the land
must honour their great mother, Nature. They must
walk in her ways. Nature does not rejoice in sluggards,
therefore they must work, and the more steadily they
work the longer they live.</p>

<p>Men of thought have always been distinguished for
their age. Solon, Sophocles, Pindar, Anacreon, and
Xenophon were octogenarians. Kant, Buffon, Goethe,
Fontenelle, and Newton were over eighty. Michael
Angelo and Titian were eighty-nine and ninety-nine
respectively. Harvey, the discoverer of the circulation
of the blood, lived to be eighty.</p>

<p>Victor Hugo was over eighty. Gladstone, who worked
every minute of his life, always in search of new subjects
to master, and who took his recreation in bodily work&mdash;gardening,
cutting down his trees&mdash;died at eighty-eight.</p>

<p>Sidney Cooper, the English animal painter, whose
work of last year will be exhibited at the Royal Academy,
London, this year, died at ninety-nine, practically with
his brushes in his hands.</p>

<p>The preponderance of females over males in the
matter of long life is a striking fact. It is also constant.
All authorities agree in this, that more women than men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
live to be very old. The more fragile pitcher is not so
soon broken at the fountain. Why?</p>

<p>One would hardly expect woman, with all the dangers
and sufferings attending motherhood, to last longer than
man. Yet undoubtedly she does.</p>

<p>I know in Brittany a peasant woman who is now
ninety-seven. She does her sewing without spectacles;
she walks a couple of miles every day; goes to bed at
eight, rises at six in the winter and at five in the summer.</p>

<p>She eats and sleeps well, and is in the enjoyment of
perfect health. She had seventeen children. The
healthiest trees are those which bear fruit every year.</p>

<p>The reason for woman's longevity is not far to seek.
Women lead more careful, regular, and sheltered lives
than men. It is the man who has to fight daily with
the world, and how hard and trying the fight often is
none but the fighter himself can tell.</p>

<p>He succumbs to more temptations than woman,
because more come his way. It is the man who is often
called upon to undermine his bodily vigour by earning
his bread at unhealthy occupations. It is he who goes
down the mines, to sea, and to the battlefield.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>WOMEN MAY ALL BE BEAUTIFUL</h3>


<p>Nothing is more difficult to define than beauty. It is
not something absolute, like truth; it differs according
to times, countries, races, and individual tastes.
Greek beauty is not Parisian beauty, English beauty is
pretty well the opposite of Italian beauty.</p>

<p>A European beauty might strike a Chinaman as very
ugly, and a Chinese beauty would find no admirer in
Europe, except, perhaps, among blas&eacute; people with the
most fastidious tastes and ever in search of novelty.</p>

<p>The Buddha of the Hindoos has nothing in common
with the Jupiter of the Greeks. Ancient art differs
entirely from modern art.</p>

<p>In Antiquity, beauty consists in the harmony of the
proportions, the purity of the lines, the nobility of
form and attitude, the sobriety of the figure, and the
coldness of the expression. In modern times, beauty
consists in gracefulness, piquancy, intelligence, sentiment,
vivacity, and exuberance of form.</p>

<p>But there are two kinds of beauty in women: that
which is natural to them, and that which they can
acquire by carefully studying what suits them best to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
wear, and how they can use to advantage their style of
face and figure.</p>

<p>I have seen women absolutely transformed by the
hands of a skilful dressmaker or a clever hairdresser.</p>

<p>The natural beauty is that happy ensemble of lines
and expression which attract and charm the eyes. It is
not at all indispensable that this ensemble should be
harmonious. On the contrary, contrasts are often less
cold and monotonous than perfect harmony, and the
statuesque beauty generally leaves us unmoved.</p>

<p>The woman who looks amiable and cheerful is naturally
beautiful&mdash;far more so than a woman with irreproachable
sculptural outlines and features so regular
that she makes you wish she had some redeeming defect
or other. Perfection was attractive in ancient Greece;
it is not now.</p>

<p>Perfection seldom looks amiable and bright, and
modern beauty must look intelligent&mdash;brilliant even.
Ancient Greece would not have looked at a turned-up
nose; but such a nose denotes gaiety, wit, spirit of
repartee, and we like it.</p>

<p>I hope I shall not offend that most talented of
French actresses, Madame Rejane, or her admirers, by
saying that Athens would have refused to look at her;
but the Parisians, the descendants and successors of the
Attic Greeks, love her, with her big mouth, square when
it laughs, and her turned-up nose. To them she is
the embodiment of liveliness, wit, and gaiety.</p>

<p>A small, piquante brunette, with small, keen eyes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
thick lips, thin, alert; a blonde dishevelled, like a
spaniel, with glorious form, will excite admiration&mdash;both
are beautiful.</p>

<p>But the other beauty, the one that can be obtained
of art, is at the disposal of every woman. In fact, the
woman who knows how to put on her dress and do her
hair well, who has on a becoming hat, pretty shoes, and
neat gloves, who has good taste in furniture, who speaks
pleasantly, smiles cheerfully and good-naturedly, who
has elegance of manners and a pretty voice, who has
a bright conversation&mdash;that woman will be declared
pretty, even beautiful, far more readily and unanimously
than the real beauty, one who fails to pay
attention to her dress and manners, who has no consciousness
of her power and her value, and who constantly
forgets that good surroundings are to her what
a handsome frame is to a picture.</p>

<p>Practically every woman can obtain this result, and
that is why I have entitled this chapter 'Women may
All be Beautiful.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>WOMEN AT SEA</h3>


<p>Of all the pitiful sights, of all the pathetic figures in
the world, there is none to compare to women at sea.</p>

<p>Is it possible that these dejected, abject-looking
bundles of misery only yesterday were the bright,
proud, elegant, queenly fashion-plates whom I saw
on Fifth Avenue? <i>Quantum mutat&aelig; ab illis!</i> What a
metamorphosis!</p>

<p>Poor things! Even the most terrible home ruler is
satisfied with the lower berth, and gives her husband a
chance to look down upon her. She is meek and grateful,
she is submissive, and her imploring eyes beg the
most hen-pecked husband not to take advantage of his
temporary superiority.</p>

<p>She arrived on board flamboyant, with her most
bewitching finery on, or a most becoming yachting-suit.
She meant to 'fetch' all the men on deck. She
went radiant to the saloon and examined the lovely
flowers which had been sent to wish her <i>bon voyage</i>.
<i>Bon voyage!</i> What irony!</p>

<p>These flowers are the very emblem of all that is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
going to happen to her&mdash;bright, fresh, and erect as the
boat starts; wet, withered, drooping, and dripping,
with no life left, twenty-four hours later.</p>

<p>She is present at the first meal, and declares to her
neighbours that things at sea are not so bad as some
people pretend, and the Atlantic is too often libelled.
Besides, she is used to travelling, and she knows a
remedy for sea-sickness.</p>

<p>Before sailing she doctored herself. She took an
infallible drug&mdash;a rather unpleasant one, it is true;
but what is that compared to the benefit derived from
it? Yes, an infallible remedy&mdash;at any rate, one that
succeeds nine times out of ten. Alas! this time is
going to be the tenth.</p>

<p>You get outside the harbour, and leave Sandy Hook
behind you. She has taken soup and fish. Somehow
she now feels she has had enough. Her appetite is
satisfied, and she goes on deck. When you see her
again, she is lying on an easy-chair, packed as carefully
and tightly as a valuable clock that is to be sent to the
Antipodes.</p>

<p>There she now lies, motionless, speechless, helpless,
and hopeless, wondering if the infallible remedy is
going to fail. The yachting-cap is no longer roguish
and cocky, but hanging over her eyes, or her beautiful
hat is replaced by a tam-o'-shanter. The damp air has
already taken away all her curls, and her hair, straight
as drum-sticks, is hanging in front and behind, and,
worse than all, she doesn't care. Provided you don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
speak to her, don't shake her, and don't ask her to
move, she doesn't care.</p>

<p>The boat is heaving. All the different parts of her
anatomy go up with the boat, but they all come down
again one by one, and she has to gather them together.
She is at sea with a vengeance! Her husband is all
right, the brute! so is pretty Miss So-and-So, who is
chatting with him, the cat!</p>

<p>Their smiles and insulting pictures of health are
more than she can bear. She is a good Christian, but
if only that girl could be sick, too! What business
has she to be well?</p>

<p>Of course, her husband has packed her up, tucked
her in most carefully, and placed grapes and iced soda-water
within her reach. He has done his duty, and
now he makes himself scarce. Maybe he is flirting on
the weather side, maybe he is in the smoke-room having
a game of piquet or poker.</p>

<p>Anyway, he is all right, having a good time. Why
isn't he sick, too?</p>

<p>For six or seven days, that bright American woman,
who runs household, husband, children, and servants
with one glance of the eye, is at the mercy of everyone
who belongs to her, suffering agonies, tortures of body
and mind, and you would imagine that a boat sees her
on the Atlantic for the last time.</p>

<p>You would think that all the beauties of American
scenery, its seashores, lakes, and mountains, will attract
her next season. Not a bit of it. In order to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
seen at the dreary funereal functions of Mayfair and
Belgravia, she will cross again. She goes where duty
calls her. She has to be 'in it' first, in the hope of
soon being 'of it.'</p>

<p>And, in order to secure her social standing on a sure
basis, twice a year she will pack her belongings and
suffer death agonies. The pluck and power of endurance
of women is perfectly prodigious.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>THE SECRET OF WOMAN'S BEAUTY</h3>


<p>The secret of a woman's beauty is not to be discovered
in her dressing-room, as cynics might intimate; it is
not obtained by the use of cosmetics, pomade, magic
waters, and ointments; by the application of red, white,
and black, neither by painting nor dyeing; the real
secret of woman's beauty lies in resplendent health and
a cheerful mind.</p>

<p>It was only a few days ago that I said to a lady, an
intimate friend of mine, who has just been promoted to
the dignity of a grandmother: 'Won't you make up
your mind one of these days to look over thirty years
of age?' My lady friend is very beautiful, and she
knows it; but she carries her beauty without any
affectation and bumptiousness.</p>

<p>She is simplicity personified, and if you were to talk
to her about her looks she would smile, and immediately
beg you to kindly change the subject of conversation.
But we are old friends, and when I asked her to tell me
what she did, that I might tell others how she succeeded
in remaining young, fresh, and beautiful, she allowed me
to insist.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well,' she said, 'let me tell you at once that I do
not spend fifty shillings a year in perfumery. I have
always retired and risen early; I have always done as
much good as I have been permitted to do; I have
always frequented cheerful and happy people, read
cheerful books, and seen cheerful plays; I have always
taken healthy exercise and indulged in plenty of fresh
air by day and night.</p>

<p>'But I should add: I have had the good luck of
being born with a cheerful disposition, and of being
brought up by cheerful and happy parents. I have
always dearly enjoyed humour, and have always been
able to appreciate it. I am a philosopher.</p>

<p>'You say that I look thirty&mdash;well, I am forty-five;
but if my body is young, my mind is younger still, and
I am perfectly sure that, when I am a great-grandmother,
I shall enjoy playing with a doll as much as
any of my little great-grand-daughters.'</p>

<p>And she went on giving me advice in minute details.
Here are a few hints which my lady readers might hear
with profit:</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Hint No. 1</span></h4>

<p><i>Never expose your shoulders and arms to cold. When
you leave a hot room to go out in the open air, cover
them most carefully so as to create on your body an
increase of temperature exactly equal to the difference
there exists between the indoor temperature you leave and
the outdoor one.</i></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Hint No. 2</span></h4>

<p><i>Avoid beds too soft and too much bed-clothing, which
cause nightmares, develop nervous irritation, and conduce
to stoutness. Never have round your beds curtains,
except as an ornament, if you like, at the head; but draw
them in such a way that fresh air can circulate freely
round your head. Renew the air of your bedroom several
times a day, and during the night, however cold it may
be, have one window slightly open, even if you should be
compelled to keep a fire all night.</i></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Hint No. 3</span></h4>

<p>Your bedroom should never be at a temperature above
sixty-five degrees.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Hint No. 4</span></h4>

<p><i>A woman enjoying good health should sleep eight hours,
nine at most, and never less than seven. Sleep is a repairing
balm which gives rest to the muscles, the nerves,
and all the organs. Late evening and night sleeps are
refreshing, but not so the sleep you may indulge in in the
morning, or the nap you may have in the afternoon.
What you want is uninterrupted sleep from eleven at
night till seven in the morning. No other sleep will keep
you fresh and well.</i></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Hint No. 5</span></h4>

<p><i>Never go to bed hungry, although you wait till your
indigestion is well over. If you are hungry take some
very light refreshment that you will digest at once and
without any difficulty.</i></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Hint No. 6</span></h4>

<p><i>No sleep is thoroughly sound and good unless your
face assumes a perfectly serene expression. To attain
this end, do not allow your brain to work at night, or
your mind to be besieged by painful thoughts. Do or read
nothing exciting. Go to bed with pleasant thoughts and
a quiet mind.</i></p>

<p>I am sure my lady friend is right; for, consulting
advice on hygiene in a book written by a famous
physician, I see that this great doctor advises the
following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
Substantial and digestible meals at regular times.<br />
Very little liquids at meals, if any.<br />
Well-aired rooms and cool bedrooms.<br />

<p>Such is certainly the secret of health and cheerfulness, and the secret

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>THE DURATION OF BEAUTY</h3>


<p>Descartes, Montesquieu, Scribe, Stahl, and many other
famous writers of modern times, not to speak of philosophers
of antiquity, have decried beauty, and warned
mankind against its illusions, and especially its short
duration, without succeeding, I must say, in disgusting
the world out of it. True, beauty does not last for
ever; but who would think of singing the praises of
ugliness because it does last? And, for that matter, I
am of opinion that beauty does last. I have known men
quite handsome at sixty, and women quite beautiful
at the same age. And even if it did not last, what
of that? Are we not to admire the sun because
it is followed by night and obscurity? Are we to
despise spring because it is followed by winter one
day?</p>

<p>Wise parents say to young men: 'Be sure you do not
marry a woman for the sake of her beauty. Marry a
woman for her lasting qualities, not for such an
ephemeral one as beauty.' Upon my word, to hear
some people talk, you would imagine that the beauty
of a woman is a thing that lasts a year at most. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
beauty of a happy woman who loves and is loved lasts
thirty years at least, and the beauty of some women is
such that if it only lasted a year, it would be sufficient
to leave about a man for his life a fragrance that all the
roses of the world put together could give but a faint
idea of.</p>

<p>Nobody complains that peaches are not as big as
pumpkins, and therefore do not last so long. Some
peaches arrived at their full maturity are so excellent
that, although they only make two 'swallows,' you not
only enjoy eating them, but you long remember the
beautiful taste they had.</p>

<p>I must say that nobody is the dupe of all the
diatribes which are hurled at beauty, women still less
than men. It has always been, and still is, and always
will be, the wish of women to be beautiful, and the wish
of men to see women beautiful. Even Ernest Renan,
whom nobody would have ever accused of frivolity,
joined the ranks, and said that the first duty of woman
was to try and look beautiful. Let a woman hear that,
in speaking of her, you have said that she was bad-tempered,
giddy, silly, extravagant, everything you like,
but that you have acknowledged that she was exceedingly
beautiful, and I will warrant that you have not
made an enemy of that woman. She may keep a
grudge against you, but not for long. But let that
woman hear that you have owned that she was sweet,
dutiful, clever, devoted, and possessed of all the
domestic virtues, but that she was far from being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
beautiful, you will discover you have made a bitter
enemy for the rest of your natural life.</p>

<p>The great attributes of a woman are the beauty of
her face and figure, the brilliancy of her mind, and
the qualities of her heart. But when a woman is not
beautiful, other women will never discuss the good
opinion you may have of her mental attainments and
sweet disposition. They will leave her in peaceful
possession of all these qualities; but if you praise her
beauty in terms of ecstasy before them&mdash;lo, they will
form the square and fight until the last cartridge is
used. It is beauty, not cleverness or virtue, that makes
women jealous of other women. And when the beauty
of a woman is perfectly indisputable, and it is almost
impossible for them to find the slightest fault either
with her face or her figure, then they declare that, unfortunately,
her beauty is one which will not last. The
dear women! how they wish they could possess that
beauty, were it but for a day!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>THE WOMAN 'GOOD FELLOW'&mdash;A SOCIETY TYPE</h3>


<p>The woman who belongs to the 'jolly good fellow'
type is frank and sincere, and as steady in her friendships
as the most perfect gentleman. In love, she is
disappointing, if not absolutely a fraud. Indeed, the
idea of her possibly falling in love would seem to her
quite as funny as it would to other people. She is of a
cool temperament.</p>

<p>In friendship, her heart is set in the right place; in
love, it is deaf and dumb.</p>

<p>She is fond of good living and of gaieties of all sorts,
both in town and country. She prefers the society of
men to that of women. She is no coquette, but has no
objection to flirting&mdash;in fact, she enjoys it, and all the
more that she knows it cannot make her run the least
danger. 'It amuses men,' she thinks, 'and it doesn't
hurt me.'</p>

<p>She sleeps, eats, drinks, dresses, rides, drives, dances,
smokes, talks, laughs, and throws her money out of
every window from the garret to the cellar.</p>

<p>People enjoy her society because she is cheerful and
gay, a bright conversationalist, generally pretty, always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
elegant and fashionable, and most exquisitely dressed.
She is unconventional, and the men like her for it; she
seldom indulges in silly gossip, and the women are
grateful to her for it. In fact, she is popular with men
and women alike, because neither of them has anything
to fear from her. The hearts of men and the reputations
of women are safe in her hands; she does no damage to
either.</p>

<p>Most people think that this type of woman is the
happiest. As a girl, yes, perhaps; but not after twenty-five.
The woman 'jolly fellow' very often makes all that
noise in order to shake off her thoughts. If her heart is
unable to speak and unable to hear, the reason often is
that it is dead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>THE WOMAN 'GOSSIP'</h3>


<p>Men and women who retail slander, whether it has any
foundation or not, ought to be unmercifully boycotted
by all decent people; and, to be just, I will say that
there is as much gossip, and of the worst kind, too,
going on in men's club smoking-rooms as there is at
afternoon tea-gatherings. Great, though scarce, is the
woman who can keep other people's secrets as safely as
her own. And how watchful women should be, and
constantly be on their guard, always mindful that not
more than one man out of ten can keep a secret. I
mean <i>his own</i>.</p>

<p>There are many women who gossip and retail scandal,
not out of wickedness or with the intention of hurting
anyone, but for the mere sake of being entertaining at
the dinner-table or round the tea-tray. When she
makes her appearance people welcome her, and say:
'Oh, here is Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;; she is so amusing; we'll hear
some good story.' Knowing that she has a reputation
to sustain, she prepares her stories before starting on
her visits, and gives them an artistic and piquant finishing
touch that will make them go down successfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Being fairly good-hearted, she begins by warning you
that she is only repeating what is 'going on,' and 'does
not know for certain.' She only wishes to be amusing
and entertaining, you understand, and does not mean to
do injury to any woman. Oh dear, no! she is a bit of
an actress in an amateurish sort of way, and if she exaggerates
she asks you to put it down to the account of
Art. As long as people are entertained by gossip there
will be people to gossip for their benefit. Now, men
and women who repeat scandal which is true do harm
enough, goodness knows, but the most dangerous ones
are those who repeat what they have heard, which
gossip will be repeated and 'improved' until it gets to
gigantic proportions.</p>

<p>Slander generally takes refuge behind such platitude
as, 'Of course, I have not seen it; I only repeat what I
have heard.'</p>

<p>Who says those things?&mdash;Why, everybody.</p>

<p>Everybody?&mdash;Everybody; that's enough.</p>

<p>Please mention a name.&mdash;Well, I am afraid I can't.</p>

<p>But where have you heard such a thing?&mdash;Everywhere.</p>

<p>Can't you be precise? Is it in a private house?&mdash;I
forget.</p>

<p>In a restaurant?&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>At a caf&eacute;? At a club? Perhaps in a theatre?&mdash;Yes,
I think it was in a theatre.</p>

<p>What a cure&mdash;temporary, at least, if not to last for
ever&mdash;to look the 'gossip,' man or woman, straight in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the face, and say: 'Scandal-mongers are the most
despicable parasites and scoundrels of society!' and you
may be sure that, at least, is a statement which the
'gossip' will not repeat.</p>

<p>There is a law of libel practically in every civilized
country to protect people against having their character
stained at the will and for the pleasure of their fellow-creatures,
but for the life of me I cannot see why libel
should be libel, and thus punishable by law, only when
it is published in a newspaper or written on a postcard.
The worst libel, the one that does most injury, is the
one that goes from house to house by word of mouth.
To say a libellous thing is quite as bad as to write it
down; it is even worse, because what is written often
escapes notice, and the law should reach the libeller
whether he has committed the offence with his mouth or
with his pen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT</h3>


<p>We all of us have heard of people falling madly in love
at first sight, men especially. No doubt there are men
who are exceedingly susceptible, passionate, artistic, and
ardent natures, who may take a violent fancy for a
woman on seeing her for the first time; but I decline
to call such a fancy love, and woe to the woman who
marries such a man, for there is no guarantee for her
that he will not many times again take such violent
fancies for other women; indeed, there is every probability
that he will.</p>

<p>I would always advise a woman, or at all events always
wish her, to marry a lover and admirer of her sex, but a
man who madly falls in love with women at first sight,
never. There is no steadiness in that man, no solidity,
no reliability, no possible fidelity in him. He is erratic
and unmanly. He may be a good poet, a talented
artist, a very good actor, but certainly he will never be
a good husband, not even a decent one.</p>

<p>There are women who are proud to say that they
inspired ardent love at first sight. They should not
be proud of it, for it is only the love of a reflecting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
lofty man that should make a woman proud. Men
may feel immediate admiration for a woman.</p>

<p>In the presence of certain beautiful women I have
felt ready to fall into ecstasies of admiration, as I have
in the presence of Niagara Falls, Vesuvius in eruption, the
Venus of Milo, or any other grand masterpiece of nature
and art; but I have never felt that I could, or must,
right away implore them to marry me or let me die at
their feet. To fall in love at first sight is a great proof
of weakness of mind, of utter absence of self-control,
and of wretched unmanliness. I believe I may affirm,
without the fear of contradiction, that love at first
sight has never proved to be love of long duration.</p>

<p>How can we imagine that a solid affection can be
the result of a caprice felt for a person whom you
had never seen before, and of whose character you
are absolutely ignorant? In certain cases affection may
follow a first impression, but only when she can inspire
as much affection by her merit as she could produce a
good impression by her charms. Only in this case can
love become sincere and profound. To form at once
a charming impression of a woman is not to fall madly
in love with her.</p>

<p>How much preferable is that love gradually increasing
through the better knowledge of the beloved one!
It is no longer an ephemeral fancy, but a solid affection.
In order to love well and truly, you must know well and
thoroughly. There must be between people in love that
blind confidence, that complete <i>abandon</i>, which can only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
be born of the sweet habit to constantly see each other
and to understand each other better and better every
day. With such love you can brave all obstacles, but
with a caprice it vanishes at the first violent storm.</p>

<p>Sincere, serious love is never love at first sight.
When one look&mdash;and the first one, too&mdash;binds a man
and a woman, you may be sure that one single word will
soon be sufficient to unbind them. Lasting love comes
slowly, progressively. Heart alone has never been particularly
successful unless in partnership with that sober
and wise counsellor that is called Reason. No love is
placed on a solid basis which is not governed by reason
as well as by the heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>THE EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN</h3>


<p>I have just digested a most interesting book by
M. Novicow, entitled 'L'Affranchisement de la Femme.'
This is a very serious subject, and I feel sure that I
need not apologize for treating it with all the earnestness
of which I am capable.</p>

<p>In a society organized in conformity with the nature
of things, woman will be brought up, from infancy, with
the same object in view as man&mdash;that is to say, in order
to learn how to live by her work. And so it should be,
since work is the universal law of biology. Every living
creature, from the invisible microbe to the most powerful
animal, works unceasingly to assure its existence.
Work being the law of Nature, to remain idle is to
resist that law and to be immoral.</p>

<p>Woman must become an independent economic unity.
There is nothing revolutionary in this; on the contrary,
it is a most conservative idea. The leisure class does
not represent one-thousandth part of society, and 999
out of every 1,000 women have, or should have, to
work to support themselves or help to support their
families.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>From time immemorial women have worked in
families, in manufactures, offices, in the fields, either
as mistresses of houses, as helps, or as servants.</p>

<p>If woman has to be recognised as an independent
economic unity, her education should enable her to earn
her living, and, whether she gets married or not, she
ought always to be ready to support herself without the
help of man. Knowledge of every description should
be placed at her disposal by the State, as well as at the
disposal of man.</p>

<p>This is not all. Not only should she receive an
education enabling her to make a livelihood, but also
one enabling her to direct her steps in life in the right
direction. She should be told the mysteries of life, and
the r&ocirc;le she is called upon to play in life. In our times
the ideal young girl is the one who knows nothing.
This ideal is absolutely false, and creates the greatest
source of danger in existence that stares women in the
face. This ideal was created by the monstrous selfishness
of man, who reserved to himself the satisfaction, the
pleasure (only a rake's pleasure) of teaching her in one
moment what, little by little, without shock, she should
learn without astonishment.</p>

<p>It is innocence that disarms women and hands them
over, defenceless, to the most odious and revolting
attempts to corrupt them. When we suppose nowadays
that a girl knows too much of the mysteries of
love, we think she is depraved; but degradation does
not come from the knowledge of certain things&mdash;it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
comes from the mysterious and unhealthy way in which
that knowledge is sometimes imparted.</p>

<p>If she were told openly, in full daylight, all she
should know of the r&ocirc;le Nature has given her to play,
she would not be depraved.</p>

<p>When a young girl shall have received from a rational
society an education that will enable her to live independently
by her work, and to behave to the best of
interests, what will she do?</p>

<p>Well, she will do exactly what men do. The rich
ones will manage their own fortune, and will engage in
pursuits, civil, political, and intellectual. They will
embrace professions, be writers, lawyers, artists, doctors,
professors, and so on. All the careers will be open to
them. In humbler stations of life, she will be clerk,
shop-woman, work-woman, servant, labourer, etc. In
fact, no woman will be prevented from entering a
career for which she has aptitude, and, by so doing, no
intellectual force will be lost to society.</p>

<p>For instance, we have lately heard, in Europe, of a
young American girl passing a brilliant examination
for naval engineering, who presented the model of a
ship far superior to anything known up to date. With
the new system a woman will not be prevented from
building ships for the State because she is a woman.
This will not only be justice to woman, but justice to
society, which has a right to benefit by the genius of all
its members, whether they be men or women.</p>

<p>Now let us examine what will become of society if all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
these transformations take place. When all the liberal
professions and political functions are exercised by
men and women alike, women will be members of
Parliament, of chambers of commerce, of literary and
scientific academies, and will sit by the side of men, as,
in America, at schools and colleges, girls sit by the side
of boys. On this account America will be the first
country to get quickly reconciled to the new state of
things.</p>

<p>The activity of women will be as indispensable to
nations and their success as that of men. But I see
other consequences. Women being no longer dependent
on men, people will be no more concerned about the
private life of an unmarried man. A woman who has
committed indiscretions will not be called a woman with
a past, but, may be, one with experience.</p>

<p>It is even just possible that men will feel more
flattered to be chosen by them. They will repeat the
word of Balzac, that a woman loves any first man who
makes love to her, and that there is nothing in this to
make a man feel proud; and Alphonse Karr goes as far
as Ninon de Lenclos when he says that the only love
that a man may feel proud of is that of a 'woman of
experience.'</p>

<p>Another thing, and a very important point. Woman,
in this future system, will be so busy with her occupations
as a bread-winner that she will have very little
time to devote to love.</p>

<p>'Woman lives by love and for love' will be thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
an absurdity. She will come across love in her way
through life. She will stop or pass on, according to
her fancy, just as man does at present. She will not be
taught early that woman was born to be a mother, and
that she has constantly to keep her artillery in good
order so as to bring down a man.</p>

<p>For that matter, it is just possible that, in those days,
it will be women who will propose to men. I should
not regret to see it for the sake of the happiness of
mankind, because I maintain that woman is a far keener
individual than man, and that a woman is much better
able to choose the right husband than a man the right
wife.</p>

<p>Of course, the frivolous woman, the doll, will have
ceased to exist, and the woman will cease to be considered
what she is in Turkey and Persia, an instrument
of pleasure.</p>

<p>The author assures us that when his system is put
into practice, it will work so well that society will
discover that it has reached a climax, the advent of
happy and perfect civilization.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Well, if it does, all I can say is that what consoles
me for getting old is the thought that I shall not be
there to see it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>SHALL LOVE BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY?</h3>


<p>This momentous question has been asked, and is daily
answered, in a Paris paper called <i>La Fronde</i>, on the
staff of which all the writers are women. This is a very
delicate question to ask, and I am not sure that it is
particularly politic to do so on the part of women.</p>

<p>That women take love more seriously than men is a
fact which, I believe, is incontestable; but what would
become of women if men were to decide in the negative
and answer that love should not be taken seriously?</p>

<p>Their only protection, their only weapon would be
taken away from them. See what happens in countries,
not civilized, I must quickly add, where men do not
take love seriously.</p>

<p>In these countries there is practically no difference
between a woman and a slave, and even a beast of
burden. The Arab, the Kaffir, the Zulu, the Soudanese,
can be seen on horseback, or walking majestically
with a blanket slung over his shoulder, while his
womankind are following, carrying a baby on their
backs, a pail of water or a cask of beer on their heads,
and the rest of the burden in their hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>These primitive creatures find all this quite natural,
men as well as women, and their greatest source of
amusement is to see a white man carry his wife's
umbrella. How they pity and scorn that poor white
man!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>They look at him, and seem to say: 'Aren't you a
man?' The more these men treat their women as
inferior beings, the more highly the women think of
the men, and the more respect they feel for them.
And we would probably do the same if love, which we
men do take seriously, did not subject, and even
enslave, us to women.</p>

<p>Indeed, this would be our right&mdash;our Divine right&mdash;and
women, I repeat, are very impolitic to compel us to
remind them of what happened at the beginning.</p>

<p>We men have a Divine right to rule over women,
and if we use that power given to us only with the
greatest moderation, it is because we love women
seriously.</p>

<p>This love for you, ladies, is your only safeguard.
See how imprudent of you it is to come and ask us if
we take love seriously.</p>

<p>Not only do we take love seriously, but I believe
that there is nothing else in this world that is taken
so seriously.</p>

<p>Love is the only universally serious thing in the
world. Ask scientists what they think of actors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
They will tell you that there is no such despicable
profession in the world. Yet actors&mdash;and rightly, too&mdash;take
their art seriously.</p>

<p>Literature and music appear to those who cultivate
them the most absolutely serious things in existence,
yet men of business, whose chief object in life is money-making,
shrug their shoulders, and feel ready to say,
like a London Lord Mayor to his son, who wanted to
devote his life to literature: 'I will be very much
obliged to you if you will decide on choosing an honest
and respectable calling.'</p>

<p>What is serious to some is not to others. There is
nothing in this world which is universally serious&mdash;that
is to say, recognised as serious by all the civilized
members of the human race, except bread and love.</p>

<p>The mission of man is to keep it alive with bread,
and we perpetuate it with love. When we have eaten
and when we have loved, we have fulfilled our mission.
All the rest is accessory, and only more or less serious.</p>

<p>Poets and artists, who help make life beautiful, are
not indispensable; they are not serious. Scientists,
who make great discoveries, help make life more comfortable;
they protect us against disease; they drug
us; they cure us, but they are not indispensable&mdash;the
world would go on without them; they are not serious.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Only as long as there is bread and there is love will
the world go on and the earth continue to be inhabited
by the human race; bread and love are serious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>I fear that I may have offended many people who
think that they are indispensable and that their vocation
is serious. Well, I am very sorry&mdash;very sorry
indeed&mdash;but I cannot help it. The world was made
thus, and when it was made I was not consulted.</p>

<p>Put aside a few men and women, most of them to be
found in the leisure class or among the parasites of
society, for whom love is a pastime, and you will find
that love is taken very seriously by men, if not quite in
the same way as it is taken by women, who are
more delicate and refined psychologists than men
generally are.</p>

<p>But, my dear ladies, as long as we men are only too
proud and happy to fight the battle of life for you, to
live for you, and, when occasion arises, sometimes die
for you, please thank the progress of civilization, which
has made us forget the origin of our relations toward
each other; do not give us reasons for reminding you
of it, and, for Heaven's sake! when we have spent years
working twelve hours a day, providing you with all the
comforts, and often the luxuries, of life, reared and
settled in the world a large family of boys and girls, do
not come and ask us if we take love seriously. You are
adding insult to injury. Yes, indeed, we take love
seriously, and matrimony too.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>ARE MEN FAIR TO WOMEN?</h3>


<p>'You are often writing about women,' fair correspondents
keep writing to me, 'sometimes praising them,
often criticising them. Couldn't you now and then tell
us something of what you think of men, especially in
their relations with women? We know you to be fair,
sometimes generous, always good-humoured. Now, do
have a try.'</p>

<p>The invitation is tempting and intended to be
pleasant, and I yield to it, not only without any reluctance,
but with a good deal of pleasure.</p>

<p>To plunge <i>in medias res</i>, Are men fair to women?
The laws, which are made by men, the usages&mdash;everything
is calculated to cause men to reduce to a minimum
the qualities, the intelligence, and the influence of
women.</p>

<p>For instance, let a woman make a reputation in art
or literature, and men begin to smile and shrug their
shoulders: they dispute her talent.</p>

<p>I maintain, without much fear of contradiction, that
a woman, in order to succeed in a profession, must have
ten times more talent than a man, inasmuch as a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
will have friends and comrades to help him, and a
woman only difficulties put in her way by man to
surmount.</p>

<p>Man receives encouragements from all sides. If he
is successful, he even knows that his talent will receive
official recognition. In France he may become a member
of the French Academy; in England, of the Royal
Academy. Orders will be given him by rich patrons,
and 'orders' conferred on him by sovereigns and statesmen.</p>

<p>Why should not women get all this? Why, simply
because man, being both 'verdict' and 'execution,' has
kept everything for himself. Personally, I have no
great liking for female genius&mdash;to my prejudiced mind
a female genius is a freak; but what I like or do not like
is quite out of the question. Here I state facts, and
why women should not have as much chance to prove
their genius as men I should like to know.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that the famous School of Alexandria,
in the fifth century, had as orators and teachers
the greatest philosophers and theologians of the time,
such men as St. Jerome, St. Cyril, etc.</p>

<p>Among these sublime intellects rose a young girl,
twenty years old, pure, radiantly beautiful, who modestly
said to them:</p>

<p>'Please make room for me&mdash;hear me. I want my
place in the glorious sun.'</p>

<p>She ascended the famous chair and began to explain
before an enthusiastic crowd the works of Plato and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Aristotle. Her talent, her learning, her eloquence
astonished the people who thronged to hear young and
fair Hypatia, daughter of Theo.</p>

<p>Now, do you believe that all those learned, bearded
philosophers and theologians encouraged her, applauded
her? No. History tells us they lay in wait in a street
where she used to pass, and when she appeared in her
chariot, resplendent with youth, beauty, and glory,
acclaimed by the crowd, they&mdash;St. Cyril and his companions&mdash;seized
her, killed her, cut her body in hundreds
of pieces, which they threw to the four winds of the
earth.</p>

<p>Now, modern Hypatias are not treated quite so
roughly by men, who content themselves with turning
them to ridicule, although I have heard of some who
did not hesitate in disposing of successful women's
reputations as the learned doctors of Alexandria disposed
of the body of Hypatia.</p>

<p>Women, perhaps unfortunately, cannot all be intended
to be mothers, or spend their lives mending socks and
attending to spring house-cleaning. Such women, who
have received a high education, may not feel inclined to
be shop-girls, ladies'-maids, or cooks. If they feel that
they have talent, and can paint or write successfully,
every man ought to give them a helping hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>A PLEA FOR THE WORKING WOMAN</h3>


<p>'There are too many men in the world,' once exclaimed
H. Taine. This was only a joke, but there is a great
deal of truth in it. There are, in France especially, far
too many men engaged in official Government offices, in
professional occupations, and in stores; too many
doctors without patients; too many lawyers without
briefs; too many functionaries, each doing little or
nothing, and the others seeing that he does it; too
many men in stores showing women dresses, silks, and
gloves.</p>

<p>And the woman hater exclaimed: 'No wonder men
cannot find a living to make; all the occupations that
once were filled by men are now monopolized by women.
The hearth is deserted, the street crowded&mdash;that's the
triumph of modern feminism.'</p>

<p>On the other hand some feminists, more royalist than
the King, exclaim: 'Woman should be kept in clover,
the prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of humanity, and never be allowed to work.'</p>

<p>And, taken between two fires, poor women are ready
to shout at the top of their voices, 'Save us from our
friends as well as from our enemies!' It is a fact that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
at a recent congress of Socialists an orator declared
himself in favour of the suppression of work for
women.</p>

<p>But women do want to work, and many of them
married, too. If what husbands earn is not enough to
maintain the family or keep it in comfort, they are
partners, and they wish to contribute to the revenue.</p>

<p>If they are not married, they want to support themselves
or help to keep aged parents. Many of them
prefer their independence to matrimony, which not
uncommonly turns out to be about the hardest way for
a woman to get a living.</p>

<p>Women have a right to work as they have a right to
live, and every work which is suitable for women should
be open to them. And when I see Lancashire make
girls work in the coal-mines I may ask, 'What work is
there that women cannot do?'</p>

<p>God forbid that I should be in favour of women
working in the mines, but this is not necessary. There
are so many men who do a kind of work that women
should do, and could do just as well, if not better, that
there should be no question of any kind of work done
by women which men could do better.</p>

<p>The earth was meant to keep her children, and she
would if everybody, man or woman, was in his or her
right place. The supply is all there and all right, but
it is its distribution which is all wrong. The same may
be said of work.</p>

<p>There should be in this world work for all and bread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
for all, men or women, only the poor inhabitants of this
globe have not yet been able to obtain a proper division
of the goods which they have inherited from nature.</p>

<p>Thanks to the discoveries of science and the openings
of new markets, opportunities for work increase every
day, but men and women are like children in a room
full of toys&mdash;they all make a rush for those which
tempt them most, and fight and die in order to obtain
them. In the presence of all the careers open to them,
they rush toward the most easy to follow or the most
brilliant.</p>

<p>Agriculture is forsaken by men who prefer swaggering
in towns with top-hats and frock-coats, instead of imitating
in their own country the virile, valiant men of
the new worlds who fell forests, reclaim the land, and
are the advanced pioneers of civilization. They prefer
being clerks or shop assistants.</p>

<p>Instead of taking a pickaxe, working a piece of land
and making it their own, they prefer taking a pen and
adding from 9 a.m. till 5 or 6 p.m. pounds and shillings
which do not belong to them. The result is that they
overcrowd the cities, and women can often obtain no
work except on condition that they accept it for a
smaller remuneration than would be offered to men, or,
in other words, submit to being sweated.</p>

<p>Is it a manly occupation to be assistant in a draper's
store, to be a hairdresser, copyist, to make women's
dresses, hats, corsets? When I see in dry goods stores
a great big man over six feet high measure ribbons or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
lace, instead of tilling the soil or doing any other kind of
manly work, I want to say to him, 'Aren't you a man?'</p>

<p>Europe is full of men doing such work. I know
America is not, although I have many times seen in the
United States positions filled by men which would be
filled equally well by women, and often better.</p>

<p>Many writers maintain that woman was intended to
tread on a path of roses, to be tended, petted&mdash;I may
have been myself guilty of holding views somewhat in
this direction&mdash;but women are not all born in 'society';
millionaires are very few, and people whom you may
call rich form after all but a very small minority in the
whole community. The path of roses can only exist
for the very few, and, besides, there are women whose
aim in life is not to be petted. In fact, some absolutely
object to being petted.</p>

<p>I tell you the time is coming, and coming at giant
strides, when every child&mdash;boy or girl&mdash;will be made
early to choose the kind of work he or she best feels
ready to undertake to make a living. The time is
coming when no poverty will stare in the face the
woman who can and is willing to work.</p>

<p>Maybe the time is coming when a woman who bravely
earns a good living will be considered not only most
respectable&mdash;she is that now&mdash;but will be envied for her
'social standard' by the frivolous, useless women who,
from morning to night, yawn and wonder how they could
invent anything to make them spend an hour usefully
for their good or the good of their fellow-creatures.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3>A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION</h3>


<p>The women's-righters are so often accused, and justly,
too, of trying to disturb the equilibrium of happiness
in family life, that they should immediately be praised
when they do something likely to establish it on a
firmer basis.</p>

<p>In Paris they have just succeeded in starting, under
the best and happiest auspices, schools where girls will
be taught how to bring up babies and how to keep
house. When it is considered that, out of about a
million children which are born annually, over 260,000
die before the age of five, it calls for the utmost care in
the watchfulness and habits of parents with regard to
young children.</p>

<p>Of all European countries, it is perhaps in France
that mortality among babies is largest. France is
being depopulated, or at least is not increasing her
population. Enough children are born, but not enough
are brought to grown-up age. This problem, over the
solution of which our legislators are very anxious, is
vital to France. It will not be solved by laws enacted,
congresses held, and leagues founded. It will be solved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
by a reform in the manners and habits of the people,
by making marriage easier, by marrying for love more
often, and by teaching French women that the first
duty of a mother is to raise her children herself, and
the second to know how to do it. This new school,
just established in France, will help in the right direction.</p>

<p>The teaching of household duties will also tend to
make marriages happier by enabling wives to be more
clever and economical. If we consider that in England
and France, which each has a population of about
40,000,000, only about 100,000 men in each country
have an income of more than &pound;500 a year, it will soon
be clear that the great problem of happiness can only
be solved by the good management of wives.</p>

<p>Girls will be taught family hygiene, domestic economy,
and the art of cooking, including that of utilizing the
remnants of a previous meal. They will be taught how
to 'shop' intelligently; that is to say, to distinguish
good material from shoddy, and thus obtain the worth
of their money. They will, I hope, also be taught how
to make a bargain, a talent which I must say is practically
inborn in every French woman of the middle
and lower classes. No woman in the world knows as
she does how to bring down the price of things to what
she wants it to be, in Paris especially.</p>

<p>Perhaps they will advise her to do what I would
advise every visitor to Italy. I take it that you do not
speak Italian. Never mind that; three words will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
serve your purpose perfectly. When you are in an
Italian shop and you ask the price of an article you
wish to buy, say to the man '<i>Quanto</i>?' (how much?); as
soon as he has named it, say '<i>Troppo</i>' (too much). Then
he will say something else. Just remark '<i>Mezzo</i>' (half
that), and then pay, and you will find that the shopkeeper
has still 40 or 50 per cent. profit.</p>

<p>When I consider that women's-righters, as a rule,
complain bitterly of men for being of opinion that the
only thing which young girls should think about is to
prepare to become one day good wives and mothers,
I believe that great credit should be given to them for
having had the idea of starting schools where young
girls will be taught all the duties of attentive mothers
and economical wives.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>I had the privilege of being present at one lecture on
the training of children, and among all the good things
which I heard on the occasion I will quote the following,
which may be of great use, even to my English readers.</p>

<p>1. Never threaten children with punishments you
may not be able or feel inclined to carry out. Don't let
your 'yea' mean 'nay,' nor your 'nay' 'yea.' You
must never be fickle or wavering in your dealing with
them, but always firm, just, and reliable, though kind
and indulgent. Don't punish them, and then regret it,
and afterwards fondle them as if to ask for their pardon.
If you do, you will run the risk of having your child say
to you: 'Ah, you see, mamma, you are sorry for what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
you have done. Instead of scolding me, I think you
ought to thank God for giving me to you!'</p>

<p>2. Don't make mountains of molehills, or be constantly
down upon children for little breaches of
every-day discipline; don't be fidgety and fussy.
Never offer them a piece of candy, a bun, or an orange
as a reward for virtues, or as a bribe to cease being
naughty.</p>

<p>Then came a few pieces of advice of a higher order,
and which I thought were sound in their philosophy.
Among these I cull the following:</p>

<p>1. Do not expect your children to become a joy to
you in your old age if you have failed to be a joy to
them in their early life and training. Do not expect
them to support you when you are old. You had a
fair start of them in life, and you should be able to
provide for yourselves. They will very likely have
families of their own. Children are often sadly thrown
back through having to look after parents who, had
they taken time by the forelock, would have been able
to look after themselves, and to have given their
children a nudge onward into the bargain. For that
matter, never have to be grateful to your children,
except for the happiness they may procure you by their
affection and the successes which they meet with in life,
thanks to the education, money, advice, and what not
which you may have given to them.</p>

<p>2. Don't let your vanity cheat you into the belief
that your children are wonders and exceptional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
phenomena, and that Nature's ordinary rules are not applicable
to them.</p>

<p>In the nursery lecture on baby culture I retained two
or three pieces of advice which seemed to me remarkably
good, although my ignorance would not have enabled
me to give them. Young mothers, please listen:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Don't squeeze your baby's head.</p>

<p>2. Never allow your child to go to bed in a bad
temper.</p>

<p>3. Never encourage it to gaze into the fire, and never
tell it ghost stories, at night especially.</p>

<p>4. Do not allow a rocking-horse before the age of
five.</p>

<p>5. Never startle a child by sudden shrieks or any
other noises.</p>

<p>6. In fact, quiet and diet will be the making of a
child strong in mind and body.</p>
</div>

<p>I could fill several pages of this book with all the
good things I heard on the occasion of my visit to that
useful school.</p>

<p>Maybe, one day such schools will be started in other
countries. I recommend this to the women's-righters
of the United States.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<h3>THE WORST FEATURE OF WOMEN AS A SEX</h3>


<p>Only a few days ago, while calling on a lady of my
acquaintance, the conversation fell on a lady singer
whom the public admired and applauded for many
years, and whose private character made her also a
great favourite in society. She left the operatic stage
a good many years ago, and went on the concert platform
under the management of her husband, who was a
well-known <i>impresario</i>. One day her voice failed her,
and so did her husband, who, realizing there was no
more money in his wife, thought that the best thing he
could do now was to leave her. With this, however,
he was not satisfied. A so-called London society paper,
having published a paragraph to the effect that he had
left his wife without any provision, this unspeakable cur
wrote to all the papers denying that he had ever been
married to that beautiful woman, who for years had
loved him, who had not only been faithful to him and
devoted to him, but had entirely supported him.</p>

<p>People in England were so indignant that I remember
the man had immediately to leave all the clubs he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
associated with, and that the beautiful and talented
woman, who had been so shamefully deceived, inspired
such keen sympathy that she was more than ever sought
in society, where her reputation was so firmly established
that the letters written to the papers could not
put a stain on her character. In spite of my reminding
my lady friend of all the incidents of the case, the only
sympathy I could extract from her was the following
remark, 'She should have expected all this,' almost to
the tune of, 'She only got what she deserved.' Then,
starting to philosophize, she added: 'A woman should
know that the man who wickedly wrongs her does not
mean to marry her; and if a woman will live with a man
without being his wife, she must be prepared to bear
the consequences of her folly, and to be one day left in
the lurch.'</p>

<p>'But,' I rejoined, 'do you mean to tell me that a
woman who, purely out of love, devotes her life to a
man, has not a right to expect that man to devote his
life to her, to protect her, to make her future safe, and
all the more so because they are not married? I am
afraid that what makes those acts of desertion so frequent
is the leniency shown by society towards them,
and the supreme contempt which women who are legally
married have for those who are not, and who are just
as respectable as they are, and very often a good deal
more so.'</p>

<p>I am in business with many people who always had
such confidence in me, and I such confidence in them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
that there were never any contracts signed between us,
and I do not think they are more afraid of my breaking
my engagements with them, because they have not my
signature, than I am of their breaking their promise to
me, because I have in my hands no contract duly signed,
stamped, and witnessed.</p>

<p>Men who deceive men, who break with them contracts
made only by word, are ostracized from society.
Why should men who deceive women be received by it
with open arms?</p>

<p>There are men of honour in the world, thank Heaven!
and if men are expected to act honourably towards their
fellow-men, can you explain to me why women should
be found who think it quite natural that these same
men should not behave honourably, not even decently,
towards women who have placed their trust in them
to the extent of not exacting their signature on a
contract?</p>

<p>The worst feature of women as a sex is the absence
of free-masonry among them. They stick together only
for the redress of more or less imaginary grievances;
perhaps the only one really momentous to their sex&mdash;I
mean the desertion of trusting women by treacherous
men&mdash;scarcely appeals to them. The woman who has
fallen through love and confidence will get no sympathy
from women, not even from the one who should give
it to her&mdash;I mean the one who has given herself to a
man, not because she loved him, but because he offered
her money and matrimony.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Women who have in hand a contract of marriage
signed, stamped, and witnessed, are so inexorable towards
their sex that they will&mdash;I am ashamed to say it
for them&mdash;rather take the part of men betrayers than
that of poor women betrayed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<h3>IS HOM&#338;OPATHY A CURE FOR LOVE?</h3>


<p>Since the publication of 'Her Royal Highness Woman'
and 'Between Ourselves,' some people, I am afraid, have
somehow been under the impression that I keep open a
sort of Dr. Cupid's office, in which I hold consultations
on questions referring to love and matrimony; and I
have received many letters&mdash;far too many to answer&mdash;in
which fair correspondents in trouble have written for
advice.</p>

<p>Only quite recently I received a letter from a lady,
who writes: 'I am madly in love with a man whom I
cannot marry, but whom I have to see on business
almost every day; what should I do to be cured?
Should I marry another man who is now seeking my
hand, who can offer me a very good position, but whom
I do not love?'</p>

<p>Now, here is a problem if you like: Can matrimony
be administered as an antidote? If so, in what doses?</p>

<p>To tell you the truth, I rather believe in hom&#339;opathy&mdash;that
is to say, in the cure of the like by the
like. You want to be cured of your love for a man&mdash;why,
love another; it is as simple as possible. Yes, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the lady tells me she cannot love that other, yet she
seems inclined to 'swallow' him as an antidote. At
any rate, she suggests that she might do so, and I
suppose she wants me to tell her whether she is
likely to be successful, if the cure will be effective and
lasting.</p>

<p>Of course, there is more chance of happiness in a
marriage which is contracted between a man who loves
a woman and a woman who does not love him than in one
contracted between a woman who loves a man and a man
who does not love her. Under the circumstances, a man,
after entering matrimonial life, is much more likely
to win his wife's love than a woman her husband's. I
believe this to be so true as to be almost taken for
granted.</p>

<p>But, my dear lady correspondent, are you going to
tell that man honestly on what terms you are going to
marry him? Are you going to trust to his intelligence,
his tact, his love, his devotion, to win your affections?
And are you going to do your utmost to help him?
Surely you are not going to deceive him, let him think
you love him, and prepare for him and for yourself a
life of misery and wretchedness, and thus build your
married life on contempt and deceit, which will lead you
to hate your husband.</p>

<p>But enough of awful suppositions, for, between you
and me, I can declare that your case is much more
hopeful than you think. The disease from which you
suffer&mdash;or, rather, from which you imagine that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
suffer&mdash;is quite curable, and is cured every day without
having to resort to such extreme measures as you suggest,
for, dear lady, do you not say to me that you love that
man 'madly'?</p>

<p>Fireworks, shells, volcanic eruptions, and mad love
have this in common: they may do harm, cause suffering,
but they last a short time only. And, pray, why
do you see the man on business every day? Is he your
confessor, your doctor, your music-teacher, your dancing-master?
Has a royal escapade of recent date, like a
'penny dreadful,' created a disturbance in your otherwise
well-balanced mind?</p>

<p>And why can't you marry him? Oh, I see, he is
married already.</p>

<p>Now, are you aware that we never fall in love madly
except with people whom we cannot marry? You say
you did not know that. I tell you you have no idea how
simple your case is, and how common.</p>

<p>By the way, would not, perchance, that man be the
'juvenile lead' who acts in the romantic drama which is
being played every day in your city? Oh, you matinee
girl! Are you aware that matinee girls invariably love
madly? Yes, as madly and as idiotically as do in the
play the heroes whom they worship.</p>

<p>Now, do not take tragically, or even seriously, such
little clouds as 'mad love.' Do not use big words for
very little things. Mad love is the easiest love to cure.
Change your doctor or your dancing-master, or&mdash;if I
have otherwise guessed right&mdash;patronize another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
theatre. Go and see 'Hamlet'&mdash;that will cure you
of 'Romeo.'</p>

<p>Then look more carefully at that very sensible man
who offers you marriage and a good position, and if you
realize that you can make him happy, and you are sure
you are not madly in love with him, marry him. And if
you study him very closely and discover in him qualities
and attainments that may lead you to fall in love with
him madly, don't tell him: he might believe you.</p>

<p>Men are so silly!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<h3>DOMESTIC TYRANTS AND THEIR POOR WIVES</h3>


<p>The domestic tyrant has redeeming features. As a
rule he does not beat his wife.</p>

<p>He feeds her well, clothes her decently, and is faithful
to her. When she is ill he sends for the doctor,
and does not grumble unless her convalescence should
last too long. He does not want her to die, because
she consents to be his housekeeper without wages and
allows him to get out of her all the work that can
possibly be extracted from one being who does not
claim the protection of the 'eight-hour' law.</p>

<p>He has enough self-control to resist the temptation
of insulting her. He treats her coolly, patronizingly,
and keeps her at a respectful distance, lest she should
take liberties with him.</p>

<p>He is dull, solemn, conceited and selfish. When he
joins the family circle, wife and children have to be
busy and silent, the only noise allowed being the rustling
of the newspaper he reads. He takes the lamp,
the only one on the table, and places it just behind his
shoulder, so as to light his paper well. His wife&mdash;poor
cat! who has to see in the dark&mdash;goes on with her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
sewing as best she can. The children remain motionless
and speechless until it is time to go to bed. Then
they smile, say good-night, and run away like culprits.</p>

<p>When he goes out the children speak above a whisper,
and the women of the family breathe and express an
opinion among themselves, an act of audacity which
they would never think of indulging in in his presence;
and life goes merrily until someone, with a face a yard
long, rushes in and announces 'Father is coming!' The
domestic tyrant is invariably called 'Father' by the
wife as well as by the children, and the word is spelt
with a capital 'F,' and the 'a' is sounded as if there
were a dozen French circumflex accents on the top
of it.</p>

<p>The domestic tyrant is neither a lazy man nor a
drunkard, nor anything that is bad. On the contrary,
he is a moral man. As a rule he does not even smoke,
and that is what makes him so powerful against reproach.
What can you say to a man who is steady, sober, intelligent,
hard-working, stingy perhaps, but asks forgiveness
for that on the plea that he has a large family to secure
the future of? Outside of his house he has a very good
reputation; he is invariably called a good husband and
a good father. He invariably speaks well of his wife.
Before strangers, before friends and relatives, in her
very presence, he will sing her praises and extol her
virtues, and will constantly repeat that for industry he
does not know a woman who could compete with her.
That is the way he encourages her in the path of duty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
The domestic tyrant is particularly great on duty, and
when he and his wife are alone, and there is nobody else
to hear him, he tells her that he fulfils his duties, and
that surely he can expect 'females' to perform theirs.
For him, women are 'females.' His wife alone can tell
you what he really is, and on the subject this is the
information you will receive from her:</p>

<p>'I have to be his slave for twenty-four hours a day,
work for him, humour him, and, most especially, I must
never complain of being ill, or even mention that I am
tired. I have never had from him a word of pity, of
condolence, or even of sympathy. I have never received
encouragements. I have never heard a word of praise
from his lips.</p>

<p>'On the other hand, it takes very little to discourage
him and make him lose his high spirits. If anything
has gone wrong with his business during the day, he
comes home frowning, snarling, quarrelsome, looking
for more trouble and grievances. He does not use me
as a consoling companion in the hour of misfortune or
as a comforter in moments of annoyance. No; he
looks upon me as a target at which he can aim all his
bitterness.'</p>

<p>And she will tell you much more than that. She
will probably tell you that the larger the family gets,
the more he is pleased, because it gives her less and less
chance of finding time to leave her home.</p>

<p>He goes out when he likes, where he likes, and would
never think of asking her, 'Won't you come along?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
You never see them out together. Poor thing! life
would be tolerable to her if they were never in together.</p>

<p>It would never enter the domestic tyrant's mind to
ask his wife if she is able to do her work alone, whether
he can help her in this or that, or simply inquire, in a
sympathetic manner, whether she doesn't feel tired after
her day's work.</p>

<p>If he should hear complaints from her he has a
beautiful phrase ready for an answer: 'What did my
mother do? What did your mother do? I am sure
you are not worse off than they were.'</p>

<p>This moral man, the domestic tyrant, is not uncommonly
dyspeptic, and bad digestion has been the cause
of more unhappy marriages than all the immorality of
the world put together.</p>

<h2>RAMBLES IN MATRIMONY<br /><br /></h2>



<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>ADVICE TO YOUNG MARRIED PEOPLE</h3>


<p>The great art, the great science of happiness, in matrimony
especially, is never to expect of life more than it
can give. Therefore, prepare your nest in such a way
that the provisions will not be exhausted in a few weeks.
From the very beginning, put on the brake, or the car
will go too fast, and will get smashed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Economize your caresses, rule your passions so as
never to make more promises than you can keep. You
cannot always work unless now and then you take a
rest, a holiday; neither can you always love unless
you proceed quietly and occasionally take a holiday.
Be sure that a holiday is as necessary to make you
enjoy blissful times as it is to make you endure hard
ones.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Do not for a moment believe that happiness in
matrimony can go on for ever and ever without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
calculation, without a great display of diplomacy on
the part of both husband and wife. Avoid being too
constantly the lover of your wife, because the lover-husband
is such a revelation to a woman that when
the day arrives&mdash;the fatal day!&mdash;on which the husband
remains alone and the lover has ceased to exist, your
wife will forget everything you may have done for her:
your constant attentions, your assiduity to your profession
or business, your forethought for her future and
that for her children&mdash;all that will count for nothing
when she realizes that the lover is gone.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Never allow a third person to interfere with your
private affairs. Never confide your little troubles and
grievances to anybody. Beware of the advising lady
who would say to you: 'If I were in your place, I
would not allow him to do this or to do that.' First
of all, she is not in your place; secondly, she cannot be
in your place, because she is neither in your heart nor
in that of your husband.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You are the best judge&mdash;in fact, you are the only
judge&mdash;of what is best for you to do in the presence of
the many little difficulties that arise in married life.
Whether you are happy or unhappy, keep the secrets
of your married life to yourself; neither your happiness
nor your misfortune will cause you to increase the
number of your friends. Indeed, if you are perfectly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
happy, it is only by remaining silent about it that you
will get people to forgive you your happiness.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Accept a life of abnegation and devotion. There is
in devotion a bliss which is unsurpassed. Devotion is
perhaps the most refined and lofty form of selfishness;
it raises you so much in your own estimation! It
enslaves so surely the hearts of those whom you love!
Devotion is not a sacrifice; it is a halo.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>If I were a woman, I would give all the pleasures of
life to witness the smile of my husband on a sick-bed as
I entered the room to come and sit by his side with his
hand in mine. In health, the man loves to feel that he
is the protector of his wife; in sickness, there is no such
arbour for him as the arms of the woman he loves.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE MATRIMONIAL PROBLEM</h3>


<p>From inquiries which I have made right and left I have
arrived at this conclusion&mdash;that, out of a hundred couples
who have got married, fifty would like to regain their
freedom after six months of matrimonial life, twenty
have come to the same opinion after a couple of years,
ten more after a longer period, and about twenty are
satisfied, though, in the last case, it often amounts to
making the best of it. Not ten of them spend their
leisure time in returning thanks that they got married&mdash;perhaps
ten, but certainly not more.</p>

<p>And I will add this&mdash;that, among my friends and
acquaintances, the couples who live most happily
together are, without exception, those who made up
their minds to be married most quickly, and did not
attempt, during years and years of engagement, to try
and learn how to know something of each other. I do
not give this as a piece of advice to those about to
marry. I simply state a fact, although I am prepared
to admit that long engagements have never been the
proper way of preparing for matrimony.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>In my opinion, the majority of marriages will have a
chance of turning out happily when the following will
have become customs and laws:</p>

<p>1. Before a man makes love to a woman with the
intention of asking her to become his wife, and before
a woman allows a man to speak love to her, certainly
before she accepts his offer of matrimony, both will
have ascertained that there is no disease, moral or
physical, of an hereditary nature in either family; that
the man has been a good and devoted son, a cheerful
brother, and an honest man in all his dealings, well
spoken of by his employers or his acquaintances; that
the girl is not an extravagant woman, and has, among
her friends, the reputation of being amiable, cheerful,
and a favourite at home; that both will have sufficient
means to support themselves.</p>

<p>I will go further. I will say that it should not only
be a custom to make inquiries about the antecedents of
the parties, and their financial position, but a law, and
a strict law, too, that would prevent couples from
marrying who were likely to present society with
undesirable children, or become a burden to the community.
I believe that no emigrant is allowed to land
in America who cannot prove that he possesses some
means of existence. No couples should be allowed to
enter the 'State of Union' who cannot prove that they
possess means to support themselves, and are healthy
in mind and in body.</p>

<p>2. Girls will be told, like in the past, that their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
destiny is to be one day wives and mothers, but they
will be intelligently prepared for both noble vocations.
They will come out of school able to keep a house,
cook a good, palatable meal, and make their own
dresses. They will know how to get their money's
worth when they go a-shopping. They will have
learned how to attend to babies, and have played
with live dolls. They will have listened to, and profited
by, lectures on hygiene. They will know all
these things, besides possessing the accomplishments
which are only meant to be dessert in matrimonial
life.</p>

<p>Boys who have never been once told that their
destiny is to become one day husbands and fathers will
be prepared to be tolerably good ones. They will be
taught the consideration that man should always show
to woman. They will be taught to take off their hats
to women and young girls, and advised to do the same
one day to their own wives when they meet them.
When they get to be eighteen or twenty, they will be
informed of women's characteristic traits. They will
be told that a woman who accepts an offer of matrimony
does a man more honour than he conferred on her by
making the offer.</p>

<p>When men and women shall by early training be
made, the former less selfish and conceited, the latter
less frivolous and extravagant, the chances of happiness
in matrimony will be greatly increased.</p>

<p>Still, the problem will not be solved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>You will never prevent matrimony being a lottery.
Take your ticket and&mdash;your chance.</p>

<p>After all, matrimony is like a mushroom. The only
way to ascertain whether it is the genuine article or
poison that you have got is to swallow it&mdash;and wait.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>WOMEN SHOULD ASSERT THEMSELVES IN MATRIMONY</h3>


<p>A cynic once said that in this world men succeed through
the qualities which they do not possess. By this he
meant to say that to cope with the pushing crowd, you
must not be too scrupulous, or you will let everybody
pass before you.</p>

<p>A worse cynic, one of the blackest type and deepest
dye, went as far as to say: 'The way to succeed is to
have unbounded impudence, popular manners, absence
of scruple, and complete ignorance of everything.'</p>

<p>But, then, take it for granted that this cynic was only
a disappointed failure. You will constantly hear the
man who has failed in life exclaim: 'Oh, if I had not
always wished to remain perfectly honest, I could have
succeeded like many others I know.'</p>

<p>Just as you hear women who fail to get engagements
on the stage or the concert platform remark: 'If I
had had no objection to obtaining engagements in the
way some women do, I would have made my mark&mdash;but
I am not one of that sort.'</p>

<p>At the risk of appearing paradoxical, and even
cynical, I will venture to say that in love, and in matrimony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
especially, certain great qualities are more detrimental
to the happiness of women than many of their
defects. And if this is a correct statement, to what
shortcoming of man are we going to attribute it?</p>

<p>I know that on reading this some women will exclaim:
'Shame on you to say such a thing!' Very well, will
you listen to me? Look around you, among all your
circles of friends and acquaintances, of relatives even,
and tell me if, as a rule, the young girl who is vain,
selfish, coquettish, a flirt even, has not better chances of
marriage, and is not sought after rather than the simple,
unaffected, devoted, intellectual girl? Tell me if the
bumptious rose does not generally carry the day over
the modest, retiring violet?'</p>

<p>Of course, I know that you will say to me, 'You may
be right; men&mdash;I mean most men&mdash;are caught, like
mackerel, by shining bait; but when a man is married,
surely he is not slow to recognise which of the two is
the right one to have as a wife, and to appreciate all
the qualities and virtues of the second one.'</p>

<p>Well, you are wrong&mdash;wrong as can be. Look around
you again, study now the married couples that you
know, and you will have to confess that the wife who
is coquettish, frivolous, clever, will know how to make
herself respected, and even feared, by her husband much
more than the other.</p>

<p>That husband will pay to her his best attentions,
will be proud of her, and will work like a slave in
order to meet all the expenses required for the adornment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
of her beauty without once venturing to make a
remark.</p>

<p>I tell you that if I had a marriageable daughter,
whom I wanted to get rid of, I would tell her to put
all her retiring ways in the cloak-room and to assert
herself, and, after the wedding ceremony, I would
whisper in her ears:</p>

<p>'My dear child, never make yourself the slave of
your husband; be good, faithful and devoted to him,
but do not forget that man is a strange animal, who
seldom appreciates what he does not pay for. In this
respect men are like those people who listen breathlessly
to music in a hall or theatre where they have
paid a guinea for their seats, and who, as guests in a
drawing-room, take the very best music as a signal for
entering into general conversation. If you want your
husband to listen to your music, make him pay for his
seat.'</p>

<p>The poor little woman who follows to the letter all
the lectures she has heard on matrimony, at home and
at church wedding ceremonies, will soon find the irreparable
mistake she has made. In this r&ocirc;le of devoted
slave she will lose her beauty, her intelligence, her very
mind, and will wither rapidly.</p>

<p>Devoting herself, body and soul, forgetting herself
always in order to increase the welfare of her husband
she will work, wear herself out, until, when her beauty
is gone, her husband will feel for her nothing but indifference,
if not, alas! sometimes contempt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>If one of the two must endure a privation in order
that the other may have more comfort, it should be the
man, always the man: first, because hard work and
privations do not hurt a man as they can hurt a woman,
physically and mentally; secondly, because a woman is
far more apt to appreciate self-abnegation in a man
than a man in a woman.</p>

<p>All this does not mean that men are all brutes&mdash;no;
although it must be admitted that there is something
brutal in their very nature which is ever fascinated by
what is piquant, and never excited by a devotion which
they feel is, above all, the duty of the stronger toward
the weaker.</p>

<p>Let women gently, diplomatically, but firmly, assert
themselves on the very threshold of matrimony, or all
the concessions which they make at the beginning will
soon be considered by their husbands as their due. In
matrimonial life, as in the government of nations, you
can never take back concessions or privileges granted too
quickly and without enough consideration.</p>

<p>Women who start married life as slaves will never be
able to assert themselves or enjoy the slightest influence
over their husbands; and bear in mind that no marriage
has ever proved to be happy where the influence of
woman, though sweet and gentle, has not been paramount.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>RAMBLES ABOUT MATRIMONY&mdash;I</h3>


<p>I have many times been asked the question, Who are
the best subjects for matrimony? I believe (kindly
mark that I do not say I am sure) that the best subjects
for matrimony are people with simple tastes, equable
tempers, no very great aspirations, satisfied with doing
little and being little. These, at all events, are the
kind of people most likely to be happy in matrimony,
far more likely than, say, for instance, the 'intellectuals,'
who are ever in search of the pathway that leads to the
higher walks of life, who have ambitions to satisfy and
many inducements to divert their minds from the peaceful
ways of contentment and happy matrimony. Little
things please little minds, and those couples, whom
we have all met in life, who know nothing, who dream
of nothing above what they have got, who are perfect
mutual admiration societies, are the best subjects for
matrimony. These people, snoring under the same
curtain, eating out of the same plate, as it were, having
the same tastes, persuaded that no one is blessed with
such children as they have, satisfied with all they do,
sure that the religion they follow is the only true one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
in the world, spend a peaceful and happy life in the
exchange of familiarities which, for them, constitute
love. They respect and enjoy each other; they echo
each other's sentiments; and their beings are coupled
together, trotting along, like two dogs well looked
after. Their discussions at home are never on any
higher questions than whether green peas are better
with duck than Brussels sprouts. They are cheerful,
smiling. She calls him Smith or Brown, and he never
speaks of her but as 'my good lady.' Before the
children they call each other 'father' and 'mother.'
They may be grocers, fruiterers&mdash;I don't care what they
are; they are happy, perfect subjects for matrimony.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>What divers and strange unions are sanctioned by
matrimony, to be sure! By the side of resigned couples,
harnessed together and painfully dragging the plough,
those who have never been able to understand each
other, through want of space, because they were too
near to make proper observations; those who, alas!
understand each other too well; sweet, amiable women
of poetic dispositions, chained to matter-of-fact, brutal
men; honest, saving, hard-working men fastened for
life to silly, thoughtless, extravagant women; romantic
women married to men who see no difference between
Vesuvius in eruption and the smoking chimneys of
Pittsburg or Birmingham; women of a keen, humorous
disposition living with dullards unable to see a joke;
Wagnerians having for wives women who prefer the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
music of 'The Casino Girl' to that of 'Lohengrin':
almost everywhere tragedy or comedy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Matrimony is a very narrow carriage. If you want
to be comfortable in it you have to be careful, or one
will soon be in the way of the other. To put yourself
to a little inconvenience now and then is the only way
of making the other comfortable. To believe that love
alone, without careful study, will resist all the shocks
and will be all the more durable that it is ardent is the
greatest mistake one can make in the world. Violent
passion may be compared to Hercules, who might have
enough strength to raise a palace on his shoulders, but
not enough to stand a cold in his head. It is the
thousand and one little drawbacks of matrimonial life
that undermine it. Love will survive a great misfortune,
but will be killed by the little miseries of conjugal
partnership. In matrimony it is the little things that
count and which, added up, make a terrible total. The
waning love of a wife will not be revived by the present
of a thousand pound pair of ear-rings, but it may
be kept up by the daily present of a penny bunch
of violets, which reminds her that you think of her
every day of your life. It is not the great sacrifices
that appeal to her as do constant little concessions.
Many men would sacrifice their lives who would not
give up smoking or their too frequent visits to their
clubs for their wives. Many women will be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
incarnation of devotion and self-abnegation who will not do
their hair as their husbands beg them to.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Surely matrimony ought to procure happiness, for
the greatest bliss on earth should be to love in peaceful
security with the guarantee of the morrow. Matrimony
is all right. So are the symphonies of Beethoven&mdash;when
they are performed by orchestras who play in
time and in tune.</p>

<p>The worst&mdash;indeed, the only serious&mdash;drawback to
matrimony is that it is an everyday meal which,
palatable as it may be, runs the risk of becoming
insipid, and of making fastidious the people who have
to partake of it. True, but then let people who are
intelligent and thoughtful supply seasoning which will
whet the appetite and combat Habit, that demon which
is their deadliest enemy.</p>

<p>It is folly, rank folly, to believe that it is wise, even
prudent, to exhaust all at once the sum of happiness,
illusion, and love with which one enters the state of
matrimony, and to give one's self body and soul until,
soon satiated and by-and-by tired of each other, both
will turn their heads away in disgust, and may, later
on, lose them in despair.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>RAMBLES ABOUT MATRIMONY&mdash;II</h3>


<p>There was a time, and I can remember it myself, when
men as well as women wore wedding-rings. It was, I
think, a very pretty custom. The wedding-ring ought
to be worn by both husband and wife, not only as a
constant reminder of faith sworn, but also as a talisman;
it should be a cherished jewel given to the
husband by the wife, as well as one given to the
wife by the husband, and given in each case with a
loving, earnest kiss impressed upon it. The wedding-ring
is such a priceless jewel in the eyes of loving
women that I have heard of some who became insane on
losing it. Why should it not be priceless in the eyes of
a man who loves his wife?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Every time that two beings who live together are
not of the same opinion or of the same taste, a concession
on the part of the one or of the other has to be
made, or trouble will follow. This is a rule without
exception. In conjugal parlance Concession is another
name for Duty. Concessions should even be made in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
everyday conversation, and long discussions most carefully
and invariably avoided. Discussions are generally
useless; they never lead to conviction, and may cause
you to run a dangerous risk&mdash;that of losing your control
over your good temper. In a wild desire to prove
that he is right, a man will blurt out words that he
will be sorry to have uttered, betray thoughts which he
always meant to keep to himself, and when the discussion
is over those words remain and the harm is
done.</p>

<p>The moment a discussion takes too lively a form, one
of the two should have enough self-control to stop
adding fuel to it and remain silent, even at the risk of
letting the other suppose that his (or her) arguments
are unanswerable. Of course, this silence should be
kind, discreet; not that odious silence of ill-assorted
couples, which is a silence of disgust and hatred. If
both man and wife are quick-tempered and unable to
avoid a heated discussion, they should leave off at once;
they should even separate and go, he to light a cigar in
his library or in the garden, she to touch her piano or
take up a novel, until both have forgotten all about it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>A mistake made by a great many married couples is
to avoid speaking of money matters. But the most
loving couples cannot altogether live on love and the
air of the atmosphere; it is not given to all of them&mdash;in
fact, it is given to only very few of them&mdash;to spend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
without having to count. A man and a wife are
two friends, two partners, who should constantly hold
pleasant little committee meetings of two in order to
discuss all matters of pecuniary interest and balance
their budget of receipts and expenditure. Once a week
at least, they should employ an hour in this way, hand
in hand, like the best of friends. Thus it is that by
mutual confidence each will encourage the other to
think of the future, and little by little both will soon
find themselves possessing the nucleus of a small fortune,
in which they will take more and more interest, and
which one day, to their surprise, will be found quite
snug and bearing an interest that will add considerably
to their annual revenue.</p>

<p>A married woman should never consent to receive so
much a week for household expenses, so much a month
for her dress, and to be treated, so to speak, as a
dependent person. It should be left to her to decide
whether, considering what the financial situation is, she
can afford two new hats or one only. The suggestion,
much less the order, should not come from her husband,
but from herself.</p>

<p>I like the French system, where a man consults his
wife in all important matters of financial interest, such
as the investment of savings, etc.; but from the day
she is married, the French wife begins to be taught by
her husband the details of his profession or business,
and the best and safest investments of the day, and
she immediately and invariably is appointed by him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
secretary of the treasury&mdash;among the masses of the
people, anyway&mdash;and that is why I have not the least
hesitation is asserting the fortune of France is so stable
and steady. It is because, thanks to the influence of
the wife, French families have their money invested in
the safest Government securities. So long as they can
work, they are satisfied with a very small interest for
their capital, in order to be quite sure that when the
days of rest will become a necessity, that capital will be
there to keep them, if not in wealth, at all events in
comfort and complete independence.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>When married couples have nothing better to do,
they should amuse themselves making all sorts of
plans for the future. They should plan journeys to
distant countries, build castles in the air, buy country
houses, and consult each other and decide how they
shall furnish them and lay out the grounds. These
plans are like barricades&mdash;they mask the future; besides,
they cause you amusement and cost nothing.
And&mdash;who knows?&mdash;among those many plans perhaps
there will be one of your predilections that you will
actually be able to realize. What happens then? Plans
are akin to caresses&mdash;they go together hand in hand;
they are the gratuitous pleasures of sweet intimacy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Young married people should avoid being too demonstrative,
not only in public, but in private, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
first years especially. They should constantly remember
that they enter the state of matrimony with a
certain capital of love. They must not squander that
capital, but live on the interest of it only.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>There are young people who too often feel the want
of manifesting their love by exaggerated proofs of
tenderness, such as the administration to each other of
names of birds and pet quadrupeds, of showers of kisses,
of little pats on the face. The exaggerated frequency
of such acts produces a reaction, and often a slight sensation
of enervation, that should never be born of caresses.
And as these outward shows of love run the risk of
diminishing in number and fervour, there is danger of
their thus becoming a sign or a proof of decline in
tenderness.</p>

<p>In public these demonstrations are ridiculous and
vulgar; they put other people ill at ease, who smile
and sneer, and even remark, 'They will soon get
over it.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>RAMBLES ABOUT MATRIMONY&mdash;III</h3>


<p>To marry a beautiful woman for the mere love of her
beauty is to undertake to dwell in a country that has a
temperature of 100 in the shade without being provided
with clothes that will enable you to stand a winter of
50 below zero when it comes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>In the relations between men and women it is, after
all, beauty that makes woman particularly attractive to
man. For this reason, the love of a man is more
sensual, more jealous, than that of a woman, which is
more affectionate, more confiding, and more faithful.
As a rule, the passion of a husband goes on diminishing
as that of his wife goes on increasing. A man exacts
of his wife her first love; a woman exacts of her husband
his last. Only the select few can manage their matrimonial
affairs with such clever diplomacy as to make
these different elements of happiness and sources of
danger work together with success.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Married people would live more happily together if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
they could now and then forget that they are tied
together for life. Any little scene that may help them
to forget it should be enacted by them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Happiness in matrimony is more solid when it is
founded on friendship through thick and thin than
when it is merely on love.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>In love a moment of bliss is nothing; it is only the
morrow which purifies and sanctifies it. How many
married couples would be happy if they would only
think of the morrow!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The husband who knows how to always keep something
in store for his wife has solved the great problem
of happiness in matrimonial life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Cupid introduces men and women into that enclosure
which is called matrimony, and then discreetly and
almost immediately retires. What a pity it is he does
not make their acquaintance later, in order to remain
with them for ever!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Marriages would be very much happier if women
preferred marrying men who love them to those whom
they love.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>Matrimony would be a glorious institution if women
would take as much care of themselves for their
husbands as they do when they expect guests at their
dinner-parties and receptions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Women should devote all their best attentions to
learning how to grow old in time and gradually, and
in remembering that tears make them unattractive, and
angry looks hideous.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>One of the greatest dangers to happiness in matrimony
is not want of love, but too much of it, at the
beginning especially. Love dies of indigestion more
quickly than of any other disease. Never satiate your
wife&mdash;or your husband&mdash;with love. Do not live on
&pound;10,000 the first year of your married life, and be
obliged to reduce your income by &pound;1,000 or &pound;2,000
every year. Begin gently, quietly, and let your
revenue, like your love, slowly but steadily increase.
There lies your only chance. With self-control you
have it at your disposal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>All vocations require preparation and apprenticeship.
Matrimony is the only one which men and women can
enter into without knowing anything about it. Alas!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE START IN MATRIMONY, AND ITS DANGERS</h3>


<p>In matrimony it is not 'All is well that ends well';
it is 'All is well that begins well, but not too well.'
Starting from this principle, I have often advised
young husbands to control themselves, and to be careful
to avoid putting all their smartest dialogue and strongest
situations in the first act of the comedy of matrimony,
for fear lest the interest should go on flagging steadily
to the end.</p>

<p>I have advised them to see that their wives do not
get their own way in everything at once, and not to
make themselves their abject slaves, because, just as no
government has ever been known to successfully suppress,
or even reduce, any liberty or privilege previously
granted to the people, just so will no husband
be able to recover one inch of the ground he has surrendered
if he capitulates on the threshold of matrimony.</p>

<p>In fact, let young husbands and young wives behave
toward each other in such a way that their friends will
not smile and say: 'Lovely, but too good to last, I'm
afraid.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>The dangers against which I have attempted to warn
men exist for women&mdash;devoted, loving women who wish
to start matrimony by trying to do the impossible in
order to please their husbands, or, if not the impossible,
at all events, what it may not be in their power to do
for ever, or even for a long time.</p>

<p>One of these dangers is that of economy.</p>

<p>'My dear,' remarked a shrewd friend to a bride of a
few weeks' standing, 'you will make a terrible mistake
if you let your husband think that you can keep house
on nothing.'</p>

<p>Young wives are sometimes pitifully anxious to be
credited with remarkable cleverness as house-mistresses.
The more they love their husbands, the less they like
the idea of their toiling and moiling. Hence they are
keenly anxious to prove themselves helpmeets in the
literal sense of the word.</p>

<p>Not only will they name a far smaller sum as housekeeping
money than their husbands can well afford to
give them, but they will actually save out of that
sum enough for their own clothes and petty cash
expenses.</p>

<p>All this self-sacrifice is not only charming, but
beautiful, when there is necessity for rigid economy.
Young couples who wisely marry on small incomes,
instead of wasting the sweetness of their youth over an
endless engagement, must make a study of ways and
means, and the wife who will cajole a shilling into doing
duty for a five-shilling piece is a jewel beyond price.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, when times are bad, when the bread-winner
falls ill, and the treasury runs dry, there is no more
pathetic and lovely sight than the brave little wife who
struggles and succeeds in keeping the wolf out of the
house.</p>

<p>But in instances where no serious demand of this
kind need be made upon a wife's ingenuity, she is a
very short-sighted woman indeed who does not see
the dangers and realize the evils of overzealous
economy.</p>

<p>There would be fewer complaints of marriages that
result in the wife being merely an unpaid servant or
housekeeper, who cannot give notice to leave, if brides
began as they meant to go on, for no one save those
who have lived through the process knows how difficult
it is to introduce a new r&eacute;gime when once its opposite
had been inaugurated and accepted.</p>

<p>'You said you would find &pound;3 10s. a week ample a
month ago. Why in the world do you want &pound;5 now?'
asks the husband, whose wife has been foolishly anxious
to impress him with her cleverness as an economist, and
finds she cannot keep up the farce beyond the limit of
a few weeks.</p>

<p>Economy may be carried too far from choice. There
are women who simply love saving. They neglect their
intellectual life, and abandon all attempts to keep in
the movement, all in order to grind down the weekly
bills. No reward awaits them.</p>

<p>The women who believe themselves perfect because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
they are economical, and consider the spring-cleaning
of their house the greatest event of the year, grow old
before their time, and are never the companions modern
wives should be to their husbands.</p>

<p>Be good, but never overdo it, I will say to any woman
who has the sense of humour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>'OMELETTE AU RHUM'</h3>


<p>When you are dining with an intimate friend, and an
<i>omelette au rhum</i> is served, what do you do? Without
any ceremony, you take a spoon, and, taking the burning
liquid, you pour it over the dish gently and unceasingly.
If you are careless, and fail to keep the pink
and blue flame alive, it goes out at once, and you have
to eat, instead of a delicacy, a dish fit only for people
who like, or are used to have, their palates scraped by
rough food. If you would be sure to be successful, you
will ask your friend to help you watch the flame, and
you will even ask him to lift the omelette gently so that
the rhum may be poured all over it until the whole of
the alcohol contained in the liquor is burned out.</p>

<p>This <i>omelette au rhum</i> is a fairly good symbol of
matrimony.</p>

<p>In the earliest stage of married life the eggs have just
been broken, beaten, and strewn with sugar, a light has
been set, and everything is burning and perfectly
beautiful. The young partakers of the matrimonial
repast are intoxicated with their new life, their new
emotions, their new sensations; they require no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
indulgence toward each other, no special cleverness or
diplomacy to please each other; there are no concessions
to make&mdash;neither of them can go or do wrong;
the flame burns of itself.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that the flame can be kept
burning for ever and ever&mdash;alas! no, not any more than
life can be made to eternally animate your body. The
flame must go out one day, as some illness must one
day end your life. But, just as hygiene teaches how to
keep our good health prolonged by precautions of all
sorts, just so does common-sense, aided by diplomacy
and skill, help us to keep alive the flame of love between
the man and the woman who have kindled it.</p>

<p>And let no woman accuse me of manly conceit if I
say that, clever and attentive as the man must be, the
woman has to be more clever and attentive still, and
that simply because it is a fact&mdash;an uncontradicted fact
(call it psychological if you like, or physiological if you
prefer)&mdash;that the love or passion of a woman goes on
naturally increasing in married life, whereas that of a
man goes on just as gradually and steadily decreasing.</p>

<p>In marriage the flame of love has been known to keep
long alive through the intelligence of the wife, and even
without any effort in that direction on the part of the
husband; but the contrary has never been known to be
successful.</p>

<p>Woman is a divine delicacy who has to tempt the
appetite of man; but the most exquisite delicacy
may become insipid if served every day with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
eternally same sauce. This is plain common-sense,
and let me tell you this: that no married life (not one)
has a shadow of chance to be happy for long unless the
woman clearly understands and quickly realizes that, if
moral duties are the same for men and women, Nature
has made their temperaments absolutely different.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>COQUETRY IN MATRIMONY</h3>


<p>No coquetry in matrimony? Who is the Philistine who
dares utter such blasphemy? Good heavens! if half
the curling-pins, which are used by women at night in
order to be beautiful the following day and attract the
attention and admiration of strangers, were used by
them in the morning, so that they might be beautiful
the same day, and draw the attention and admiration
of their husbands, there would be happiness in matrimony,
and the world would go much better than it
does.</p>

<p>The greatest, the most dangerous enemy of happiness
in matrimony is habit which engenders monotony. You
get too much accustomed to each other, and love fades,
as a flower which falls off its stem before it has lived its
natural life, owing to some insect which destroys it.</p>

<p>That insect in matrimony is habit, which devours
everything without your being aware of its presence.
Destroy that insect before it has had time to do any
harm, and you will have saved your dual happiness.</p>

<p>A grave error committed by many women is to
believe that they must look their best for the friends,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
acquaintances and strangers who visit them, but that
they need not take much trouble for their husbands.</p>

<p>But the fact is that a woman ought to ever appear
before her husband at her very best, whether it is in a
morning neglig&eacute;e or in a full afternoon or evening
toilette.</p>

<p>Your husband, my dear lady, ought to see in you
more than he could see in any other woman. All comparisons
ought to be to your advantage. It is not at
all necessary that you should have an expensive gown
on at breakfast-time. Your hair well fixed, and a nice-fitting
dressing-gown may make you look as attractive
as a beautiful ball-dress.</p>

<p>It is not clothes that make a woman fascinating; it
is the way she puts them on.</p>

<p>In fact, never allow yourself to be seen by your
husband in any other state than that in which you
would allow yourself to be seen by the male portion of
your acquaintances, not even in illness. As long as
your strength permit, remain coquettish and jealous of
your appearance. Yes, I say, even on a sick-bed.</p>

<p>The part you have to play consists in spraying a
perfume of poetry around you. Fill your husband with
remembrances of you, so that, even when you are not
visible, you are present before his eyes.</p>

<p>Allow him the most complete liberty, and never ask
him questions on what he has done, where he has been.</p>

<p>Take it for granted that he has done nothing which
he should not have done, that he has been nowhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
where he should not have been, and it is that perfect
confidence which you show you have in him that will
always keep him in the path of faithfulness, unless he
is, which is only exceptional, an absolutely bad man.</p>

<p>If clouds are gathering over your happiness, it is for
you women to clear them away. You are the guardian
angels of the home, which is your kingdom. If you
have trials, strain every nerve to appear smiling, and if
sometimes tears stifle you, shed them in secret, even
should the cause of your trial be the inconstancy of
your husband.</p>

<p>You will not bring him back to you with reproaches,
tears and scenes. You will thus keep him away for
good. Remember that Nature, which has treated you
so ungenerously, makes you ugly when you weep and
hideous when you make a scene.</p>

<p>You will bring back an erring husband by your kindness,
your sweetness, your devotion, and your intelligence.
The only infallible way to get a husband
attached to you is to let him believe that you never
suspected him, much less accused him, even when he
was guilty. Call to your aid whatever resources are at
your disposal&mdash;resources of intelligence, of beauty, of
abnegation&mdash;and, if your husband is not a brute, he will
return to you, and he will be all the more ashamed of
the way in which he neglected you for a time that, by
your behaviour, you seem to consider he had never for a
day ceased to love you.</p>

<p>Never make an allusion to the fatted calf which you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
killed on the return of the prodigal heart. Be as
merciful in your victory as you were in your temporary
defeat.</p>

<p>Do not be satisfied with forgiving; forget, and make
him forget everything. Use scales: on one side place
his years of devotion to you, his industry, his forethought
in securing your future and that of your children; on
the other his faults; and even if these scales should
incline to remain horizontal, with a gentle touch of
your finger make them go down in favour of what he
has done for you.</p>

<p>The supreme coquetry of a woman is to know how to
reign, even when her husband governs. Her very weakness
is the best weapon in her hands. Her husband
should be the motive of all her actions. Before thinking
of appearing beautiful to the indifferent, she should
think of appearing beautiful to her husband.</p>

<p>If she is admired, she should feel proud of it for his
sake, and make him understand that only crumbs are for
strangers; that he alone is invited to the whole meal of
her beauty, her love, her boundless devotion.</p>

<p>And let me add that there is not, in this chapter, a
single word of advice which I give to women in their
dealings with husbands which I do not endorse and give
to men in their dealings with their wives.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>RESIGNATION IN MATRIMONY</h3>


<p>According to characters and circumstances, resignation
is the virtue of the weak or the virtue of the strong. A
woman resigns herself to her fate in married life, sometimes
because she has not enough strength of will,
sometimes because she does not deign to revolt, oftener
still because she discovers that her rebellion could only
make matters worse for herself, and especially for her
children.</p>

<p>If her husband is good, her resignation will soon
bring him back to her; if he is bad, her rebellion will
make him much worse.</p>

<p>If you cannot sympathize with your husband, or
adopt his views and manner of thinking, resign yourself,
keep your views for yourself, and do not transform
your married life into an eternal French public meeting,
where, instead of striking pebbles together in
order to obtain light, they throw them at one another's
faces.</p>

<p>Fulfil your duties. Never complain. Never exact
what is not offered to you, unless it be respect. So long
as your husband treats you with respect, at home as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
well as in public; so long as he is the thoughtful father
of your children, and carefully and industriously attends
to his profession or business, respect him and inspire in
your children the respect for him, and especially do not
make your children the confidant of your grievances;
that is your foremost duty.</p>

<p>I cannot say to you: Try to force yourself to love
your husband. This is not in your power. But I
will say: Be irreproachable, and thus make yourself the
superior of your husband. Devote yourself to your
family. If you are rich, do with your money all
the good that you can. The greatest possession is
self-esteem. You can rise so high that the offences
committed against you may appear infinitely small.
After all, we get in this world the place that we
know how to make for ourselves.</p>

<p>Never let the outside public know the details of your
private life. Receive your friends and your guests with
a smile on your lips. If your husband is a gentleman,
he will show you before them the greatest consideration,
and if you are a lady you will treat him in a like
manner.</p>

<p>If your husband is unable to offer you his love&mdash;I
mean a lover's love&mdash;do not commit the mistake of
refusing his friendship, for it is just possible that this
man, who has not in him the power to love you as a
lover, would still be ready to give his life for you.</p>

<p>He would certainly be still ready to give it for his
children, <i>your</i> children. Surely that friendship is worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
having. Of course, the young wife, who discovers after
only a few years of marriage that the dream of love has
vanished, is to be pitied, supposing that it has not been
through her fault that the dream has had such a short
life; but the woman who for twenty or more years has
had a faithful lover-husband is conceited and ridiculous
beyond measure when she does not almost cheerfully
resign herself to the inevitable crisis in matrimony; and
if she has children that she takes in her confidence, and
thus estranges from their father, her vanity is not
very far from criminal. At all events, she deserves
the sympathy of no one.</p>

<p>Resign yourself to the inevitable. Let the days of
love, happiness, and devotion count in the final reckoning,
and, in turning over a new leaf, be sure you bring
forward devotion, and soon happiness may have to be
added again.</p>

<p>Put on a cheerful face always, and remember that it
pays to excite envy, never to excite pity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>TIT FOR TAT</h3>


<p>There is more joy in heaven, we are told, for one sinner
who repents than for a hundred righteous people who
keep straight on the narrow ways of salvation.</p>

<p>And, I should add, there must be more joy in hell for
one good man who goes wrong than for a hundred
sinners who persevere in their wicked ways.</p>

<p>There should be more joy in the heart of a woman
for a man who remains in love with her than for a
hundred others whose admiration she may obtain.</p>

<p>There are some women who may love a man ever so
much, and be loved by him to their hearts' content, who
will use all their artillery to bring down strangers to
their feet, but who will make little or no effort to look
their best for the man who loves them and is devoted to
them. For such women their beauty is an altar erected
to unknown gods.</p>

<p>Married life would be an everyday bliss and an eternal
one if men never thought of doing to or before their
wives what they would never dream of doing to or
before any ladies of their acquaintance, and, of course,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
if women did the same; but such is not always, even
often, the case. Hence the trouble.</p>

<p>How many men have taken their wives to a ball,
women whose radiant beauty and brilliant toilettes have
caused the admiration of all men present, and also the
envy of many women?</p>

<p>How many men have felt that, if the said wives had
made as much preparation for them as they had for all
the strangers present at that ball, they could have fallen
at their feet and worshipped them?</p>

<p>On returning home, however, Madame has immediately
retired to her room, ordered her maid to quickly
remove and pack away the lovely attire, and, an hour
later, prepared for the night's rest, she appeared before
her husband with her hair all prepared for the next day,
her hands carefully gloved so that they may be as white
as snow&mdash;also for the next day&mdash;and wrapped up and
as inaccessible as a valuable clock that is going to be
shipped to the other end of the world.</p>

<p>That is the lot of many men&mdash;may I not even say of
most husbands? Then a bold husband will venture to
make some remarks. He will say, 'Now, my dear, I
hear you practise your scales and exercises, but seldom
do you treat me to a piece of music, which I only hear
when I have guests or we go out. Everyone&mdash;at the
ball&mdash;has admired your beautiful hair and your lovely
gown, but for me, all I see is hairpins and curlers and a
dressing-gown.'</p>

<p>And Madame will answer more or less sourly, 'Is it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
because I am your wife that I must grow ugly? Do
you want my hair to fall over my neck and shoulders
to-morrow like weeping willows? Do you want my
hands to be red and chappy? Are you sorry I am careful
of my clothes and have them put away, well folded
in tissue-paper, when I have no need of them?</p>

<p>'Do you reproach me for doing you honour and being
at the same time careful? Will you tell me, is there
any way to please you? And do you think that, after
enjoying herself and receiving compliments during a
whole evening, it is very pleasant for a woman to return
home and hear nothing but rebuffs, reproaches and the
like?'</p>

<p>The poor man feels he is beaten, that he is a brute,
and he says nothing more, until one night when it is
time to retire, he prepares a surprise for his wife.</p>

<p>'What's all this?' exclaims the wife when she realizes
what has happened.</p>

<p>'Nothing, dear,' he replies. 'To tell you the truth,
I go hunting to-morrow morning, and I shall have to
rise very early. My hunting-boots are new, and in the
morning my feet are always a little swollen, so I keep
them on to save trouble. You must excuse my spurs,
too, dear, but I prefer these, which are fastened to the
boots. I shall be most comfortable to-morrow.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE IDEAL HUSBAND</h3>


<p>There are qualities which most women admire in men,
and there are qualities which practically every man
admires in all women; but if you were to ask of a
hundred men, 'What is the ideal wife?' and of a
hundred women, 'What is the ideal husband?' you
would get a hundred opinions all different one from
the other.</p>

<p><i>Quot capita, tot sensus</i>, which, in the case of women,
I should like to translate, 'So many pretty heads, so
many different opinions.' This, however, is as it should
be. Only there remains that terrible problem for every
man and woman to solve: Find your ideal if you can,
and when you think you have found it, see that you are
not disappointed.</p>

<p>I have of late interviewed a good many Parisiennes
on the subject, and I will give some of the answers
which I have received.</p>

<p>One said to me: 'The ideal husband is the one who
devotes his life to his wife, who makes her the first
consideration in all his thoughts and acts, who understands
that she is the aim of everything which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
undertakes, and that he should use all the resources
that Nature has placed in his mind and Fortune has
put in his hands in order that she may be happy and
remain long beautiful.'</p>

<p>I need not say that this was the opinion of a young
girl who had only just made her d&eacute;but in society. Nor
do I need say that the following came from the lips of
a married woman&mdash;one, however, whom I guarantee to
be in the possession of all the womanly virtues likely to
make a husband most satisfied with his lot.</p>

<p>'The ideal husband,' she said, 'is the one who lets
his wife alone, who does not interfere with her household
duties or any of her little womanly fads, who is
not always paying her compliments or besieging her
with advice, and who is not always by her side or
behind her back, who seldom addresses her reproaches,
and never reminds her of what he has done to deserve
her gratitude, who is not fussy, fidgety, or a bore of a
model of propriety and virtue.</p>

<p>'When I was a young girl I dreamed of matrimony
as a sweet state of slavery. Now I shout for liberty&mdash;liberty
for him and liberty for me. I do not mean to
say, of course, that man and wife should live apart and
not care one what the other does. No, no; but I
firmly believe that we should remain at a respectful
distance from the objects which we want to see to
advantage and admire.</p>

<p>'A woman should never allow even the most loving
and beloved of husbands to be constantly making love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
to her. One may suffer from abundance of wealth. A
great deal of discretion and a certain amount of respect
between married people are sure to secure the duration
and the solidity of their affection. Those who live at
too close quarters are sure to part one day or the
other.'</p>

<p>Here is another, with less philosophy, but a good
deal of what I might call paradoxical psychology:</p>

<p>'The ideal husband,' said to me a woman married to
a French painter on the road to celebrity, 'is the one
who is not a man of genius. Nothing monopolizes a
man like a great talent for writing, painting, or even
business; he belongs to his muse, his art, or his figures.
His thoughts are absorbed, and he has very few, if any,
left for the little creature who lives with him, not in
the clouds, but by his side on this earth.</p>

<p>'When he returns from his dreams, he throws at her&mdash;poor
inferior being!&mdash;a glance of pity, if not of contempt.
My ideal husband is a man who can live for
me as I am ready to live for him, and who can do
without a mistress, whether that mistress be called
Literature, Art, or Commerce. I love great men, great
poets, great painters or sculptors, but I would not have
a great man for a husband; nay, furthermore, I should
like to have a husband jealous of all the great men of
my predilection in the world of fiction.'</p>

<p>A piquant little woman, not a bit beautiful, but
absolutely charming and the embodiment of amiability
and cheerfulness, said to me:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>'The ideal husband shall not be a handsome man,
but a gentlemanly one, with a keen sense of humour,
cheerful, a laughing philosopher, and a man with a
magnanimous turn of mind, who would never take
advantage of a little trouble in which I might find
myself entangled to say to me, "I told you so," but get
me out of it quickly.'</p>

<p>Of course, all my fair friends, without exception, have
insisted on the ideal husband being indulgent, generous,
manly, sincere, loyal, and above middle height. Strange
to say that none of them ask him to be handsome,
much less insist on it. One of them even went so far
as to say:</p>

<p>'A husband should not be handsome. First of all
he is never very beautiful, since he is a man. But he
might be worse; he might think he is beautiful, and
then Heaven help his wife!'</p>

<p>'The ideal husband,' remarked a lady, 'is a man who
should never be ridiculous, never make a fool of himself,
and never for a moment believe that women took notice
of him. A woman's love may survive any defect in her
husband, but ridicule never.'</p>

<p>The fact is that words or acts of a man ridiculous
enough to make his wife wish she were a mile deep
under the floor will lower him so much in her estimation
that she will never be able to look up to him again;
and no woman has ever been known to drop her love&mdash;she
sends it up always. I will conclude with the opinion
of an American lady:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>'The ideal husband should never part with any of
his most refined manners in his home, where he should
endeavour ever to appear at his best, in dress, language,
and behaviour, in the presence of his wife, who is his
queen.'</p>

<p>I expected as much from her supreme and magnificent
majesty, Mrs. Jonathan, Queen of the United
States.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>MARRYING ABOVE OR BELOW ONE'S STATION</h3>


<p>It is said in England that, of all men who occupy high
positions in professional life, judges are those who
oftenest marry below their station.</p>

<p>Many are even said to have married impossible
women, and on these women many amusing stories are
related in the smoke-rooms of London clubs&mdash;stories
which, I have no doubt, are of the <i>se non &egrave; vero, &egrave; ben
trovato</i> type, and as faithful to truth as the stories that
are told on the feet of the Chicago women or the intellect
of the Boston girls.</p>


<h4>CHORUS-GIRL MARRIAGES</h4>

<p>However, it must be admitted that fools are not the
only men who marry women that are greatly inferior to
them in manner, education, and social standing; the
cleverest men and the most aristocratic ones have often
been known to do the same.</p>

<p>Dukes, marquises, and earls have married chorus-girls
and shop-girls; great literary men and artists
have married uneducated girls, and have led very happy
lives with them. Of course, I pass over the aristocracy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
who marry among the common people in order to get
their coats of arms out of pawn. If they are poor and
marry rich girls, you can hardly call this a case of
<i>m&eacute;salliance</i>, since the superiority of birth in the man is
compensated by the superiority of fortune in the
woman.</p>

<p>Of course, <i>m&eacute;salliances</i> appeal to people, because
they always suggest marriages for love, and novelists of
all countries have worked this theme for all it is worth.
In real life they very seldom work well, for the simple
reason that matrimony places a man and a woman on
absolutely equal footing, and that happiness for them,
in the case of a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>, is only possible on condition
that one goes up to the level of the superior, or the
other comes down to the level of the inferior.</p>


<h4>EDUCATING ONE'S WIFE</h4>

<p>Marriages that have the greatest chances of success
are those in which the two partners bring the same
amount of capital in social position, in education, in
fortune, in character, and I will even add in stature and
in physical beauty, with perhaps a slight&mdash;a very slight&mdash;superiority
to the credit of the man in all these conditions,
except that of beauty, which is an attribute that
woman can possess in any degree without making the
happiness of her husband and herself run any risk.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hodgson Burnett, in one of her novels, makes a
barrister fall in love with a girl who works in the coal-mines
of Lancaster (another case of the legal profession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
going wrong). The man has the girl sent to school to
learn manners and get educated, then marries her,
and all is smooth ever after.</p>

<p>I have heard of this being done in real life with less
success. The behaviour of the man in a case like this
should create gratitude in the heart of the woman, and
gratitude does not engender love. On the contrary, Cupid
is a little fellow so fond of his liberty and so wilful that
anything that tends to influence him&mdash;worse than that,
to force him&mdash;has on him the contrary effect to that
which should be expected.</p>

<p>Yet, I say, it is the only way to bring an uneducated
woman to the level of an educated man&mdash;before matrimony.
After marriage the woman is acknowledged,
proclaimed the equal of her husband, and she will stand
no hint as to her being inferior to her husband in any
way.</p>

<p>If she loves him and is not conceited, any act on his
part, however kindly performed, that would suggest to
her that she might improve herself in language, behaviour,
etc., would cause her unhappiness and even
pangs of anguish.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, she did not love him and was
conceited, or even only of an independent character,
she would soon give him a piece of her mind on the
subject of her improvements, and let him hear the great
typical phrase of democracy, 'I'm as good as you.'</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>DANGEROUS EXPERIMENTS</p>

<p>No, no; he must put up with the situation, and make
the best of it. In that case men console themselves
with the thought that their wives are pretty, or that
they are good housekeepers, good cooks. After all, a
man gets married to please himself, not for what the
world has to say of his wife.</p>

<p>Still, you have to succeed in the world, and if you
despise the opinion of the world the world turns its
back on you. And you must remember this: however
big you are, or you think you are, the earth can go on
running its course round the sun without your help.</p>

<p>French and American women have a keen power of
observation and native adaptability. Better than any
other women in the world, they can soon adapt themselves
to new surroundings and new ways, and learn
how to talk, walk, dress, and behave like the leading
women of any new social circles they may have entered.
Witness the American women that are to be seen at the
courts of Europe.</p>

<p>However, the experiment of a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i> is always a
dangerous one to make. Nine times out of ten the
rabbit will always taste of the cabbage it was brought
up on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>PREPARE FOR MATRIMONY, BUT DO NOT OVERTRAIN YOURSELVES</h3>


<p>I'll tell you what the trouble is with most women in
connection with matrimony&mdash;they expect too much out
of it. Not only do they expect too much, but, in their
goodness, they prepare themselves to do too much, to
give too much; in fact, they overtrain themselves.</p>

<p>The moment a woman is in love and becomes a
fianc&eacute;e she cultivates the growing of her wings, and
orders a halo for her head&mdash;in fact, she sets herself to
rehearse the part of an angel.</p>

<p>But see the 'cussedness' of things! Man is a strange
animal, who prefers women to angels, and the result is
that things go wrong. The dear soul is persuaded that
she is going to marry a hero, a demi-god, and very soon
she discovers that, after all, she has married only a man.
How few of us can stand comfortably and long on the
pedestals that our admiring friends have erected
for us!</p>

<p>When that woman engaged herself she did not go
straightway to her parents, as she should have done, and
ask them for information on man and matrimony. Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
father might have gently disabused her on the subject
of many illusions. Certainly her mother would. No,
she did not do that. She kept to herself, read poetry,
invented poetry, filled herself with poetry.</p>

<p>Boys dream of military life. To them it means
gorgeous uniforms, a sword, a life of adventure, battle
and glory. Girls dream of married life. To them it
means beautiful dresses and jewels and a life of love-making.
But soldiers do not always fight, and husbands
do not always make love, and that is why military life
and married life are often so sadly disappointing.</p>

<p>The dear little woman has prepared herself to be
loving and devoted every minute of her life. She has
stored provisions of all the best resolutions and virtues
under the sun and above. She arrives in her new home
ready to yield in everything, even ready to run the
house and dress on nothing a year. How she loves that
man! Her whole being is given up to love. By-and-by
she discovers that the most loving couples require
one or two meals a day, and that fig-leaves are much
more expensive than they were when they were first
worn. Her husband, who, like all men, is an idiot as
far as the knowledge of housekeeping is concerned,
begins to grumble when she asks for a reasonable sum
to allow her to keep things going decently. Remarks
pass, lectures are delivered, faces frown, and frowning
faces don't go well with halos.</p>

<p>Why will young girls leave it to their imagination to
find out what married life is? Why do they not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
consult and listen to the advice of married lady friends,
choosing those who are happy, of course?</p>

<p>They would hear the voice of common-sense.</p>

<p>'If you want your husband to love you and be happy,
my dear,' some old stager will tell her, 'follow <i>Punch's</i>
advice&mdash;feed the brute. Never expect him to be loving
while he is hungry. The way to his heart is through
the portion of his anatomy that lies just under it.'</p>

<p>Another will say to her: 'Don't start married life by
keeping your house on nothing a year, because your
husband will find it quite natural, and will get used
to it.'</p>

<p>Let that girl frankly confess to her sweetheart that
she is not an angel, and the probability is that, if he is
a man, he will say to her: 'Never mind the angels,
dearie; be a woman: that's quite good enough for
me.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>ACTRESSES SHOULD NOT MARRY</h3>


<p>'Are you married?' once asked an English magistrate
of an actress who had been summoned for assault. She
had flung a pot of cold cream in the face of her
manager.</p>

<p>'No, sir,' replied the lively lady, 'nor do I wish
to be.'</p>

<p>'That is fortunate for your husband,' remarked the
judge, who probably had Irish blood in his veins.</p>

<p>The actress&mdash;I do not mean the mere woman on the
stage&mdash;is made by her profession unfit for matrimony.
If she is fit for it, she is not, and never will be, a great
actress.</p>

<p>I know that you will at once tell me that Mr. and
Mrs. Kendal and Mr. and Mrs. Cyril Maude (Winifred
Emery) have been married a good many years and lived
most happy lives together. I even imagine that you
will easily be able to name others, but I will still maintain
that they are only exceptions, and you will please
remark that in the exceptions I have named the
husbands have, as actors, quite as high a reputation as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
their wives, which may be the very explanation of those
exceptions.</p>

<p>The actress is a heroine, partly owing to the r&ocirc;les
that she plays, and partly to the talent which she
displays in them, and no heroine can be a good wife to
a man unless he be a hero himself. A woman can
never drop her love, and she never does; she gives it
only to a man she can look up to.</p>

<p>But there are a great many other reasons. An
actress wants perfect freedom of action. She cannot be
bothered by household duties, hampered by the bringing
up of children, mindful of the attentions required,
or at least expected, by a husband.</p>

<p>Her soul and her very nervous system have to be
stirred by the whole gamut of sentiments, sensations,
and even passions, or she will never be able to stir the
soul of her audience.</p>

<p>Can you imagine Lady Macbeth, Camille, Fedora,
Phedre, La Tosca, Brunnehilde, played by young innocent
virgins or by attentive and devoted wives who mend
their husbands' stockings and make the puddings?
Perhaps you will tell me that Mrs. Kendal does all that,
and if you do, my reply will be, 'Will you please leave
me alone with Mrs. Kendal?'</p>

<p>However, since we have mentioned the name of that
great actress, I will quote her, and repeat what she said
to me one day: 'It is a general rule with me never to
engage married couples in my company; whenever I
have done so I have had trouble. I want both men and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
women to act in my plays without having to mind what
their wives or husbands may look like in the wings while
they are making love on the stage.'</p>

<p>The husband of an actress is nine times out of ten
an intolerable bore. He is jealous when she rehearses,
he is jealous when she plays, he is jealous when the
audience applauds her, he is jealous when she receives
bouquets, he is jealous and suspicious if the manager
increases her salary, he is jealous during the intervals,
he makes scenes to her when she returns home, and, if he
does not, he sulks, which is worse, because the man who
consumes his own smoke is far less bearable than the
one who 'has it out' and has done with it. Even if he
is not all that, he has that feeling, which we can quite
understand, that his wife belongs to the authors of the
play, to the manager of the theatre, to the public, to
the critics&mdash;in fact, to everybody except himself.</p>

<p>No, actresses should certainly not marry unless they
marry actors, but as a rule they do not, and will
not.</p>

<p>The actor may be a hero to the susceptible matin&eacute;e
girl, who sees him as Othello, Hamlet, Romeo, Henry V.,
d'Artagnan, or some other romantic swashbuckler, but
he is no hero to the woman who dwells in the dressing-room
next to his, and who knows that he is putting on
his wig, smearing his face with grease-paint, making-up
his eyes, and covering his face with violet-powder with
a puff, which he handles in ladylike manner. The actor
loses in the eyes of an actress all the prestige which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
due to mystery and imagination, and which constitutes
the primary and fundamental element of the attraction
of one sex for the other. I have never met actresses
of standing who had admiration for actors as men,
much as they might praise them as members of their
profession.</p>

<p>Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the marriage of
an actress is a mistake, a remorse, or an act of folly. An
actress, in order to interpret the works of dramatists,
should love, love passionately, dream, suffer even terribly,
in order to be able to incarnate love, voluptuousness,
suffering, and despair. The drama is the reflection of
humanity; the art of the actress should be the reflection
of all the different passions that have stirred her own
heart and soul.</p>

<p>Another thing: The public takes a greater personal
interest in a woman who is not married than in one who
is. Actresses know this so well that, when they are
married, they insist on having their names put on the
bills as Miss So-and-So. When they do not, managers
make them do it.</p>

<p>For art's sake, for her own sake, and, remembering
the remark of the magistrate, I will add, for her
husband's sake, an actress should not marry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>A MATRIMONIAL BOOM</h3>


<p>There is quite a boom in the French matrimonial
market just at present, and not marriages of convenience
either, but real good love matches. Young girls
elope with respectable young men holding good positions
in order to compel their parents to give their consent.
Sons now inform their fathers and mothers that
they have, without their help or even their meddling,
chosen wives for themselves. It is an open state of
rebellion against the old state of affairs in France.</p>

<p>Hitherto there were practically only two kinds of
marriages among the upper classes and the good
bourgeoisie of France: the marriage of convenience
from which love was excluded, and the marriage for
love, which, nine times out of ten, was a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>.
And, to do justice to the old system, let me say that,
as a rule, the marriages of convenience turned out to be
much happier than <i>m&eacute;salliances</i>, which generally consisted
in marrying mistresses&mdash;that is to say, according
to Balzac, in changing tolerably good wine into very
sour vinegar. However, in these marriages of convenience,
arranged by families, the social position of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the bridegroom and the dot of the bride were the first
considerations, and these couples, after being married,
often discovered they were made one for the other, and
more than one husband won his wife by courting, and
really fell in love with her. In cases of <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>,
after the hours of passion had gone, the husband discovered
that all his prospects in life were destroyed
through being married to a woman he would never be
able to make acceptable to the people of the set he
belonged to, and often despair followed disgust, for woe
to married people if either of them has the slightest
cause for being ashamed of the other!</p>

<p>But things are being changed, and a splendid sign of
the times it is, too. Young Frenchmen now seek wives
among the families of their own stations in life, court
them, and make up their minds to marry them, and,
what is best of all, parents begin to realize that, after
all, it is their sons, and not themselves, who marry, and
that it is they who should make their choices.</p>

<p>I believe that this new state of things, which I hope,
for my country, will last, and even yet improve, is
greatly due to the influence of the Anglo-Saxons,
English and Americans, whose freedom in matrimonial
matters is getting more and more familiar to the French
through reading and travelling.</p>

<p>Like the Anglo-Saxons, they begin to see the practical
side of matrimony. The young Frenchman says
to himself: 'I do not send my father to my tailor to
choose the clothes I am to wear, and I do not see why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
I should allow him to go and choose for me the girl I
am to marry.'</p>

<p>There are other reasons which may also be due to the
ever-increasing influence of Anglo-Saxon manners and
customs on France. The French girl is every day
getting freer. She is no longer cloistered, as it were,
at home and at school. She now frequents the society
of young men, gets better acquainted with them, and on
more intimate terms than before. She is more independent,
feels more confidence in herself, knows more of life
than before, and the consequence is that she is better
able to provoke the love which she desires to inspire in
a man of her choice.</p>

<p>There may also be an economical reason which
incites young Frenchmen to seek love in matrimony
instead of outside of it. They have been observing
their elders, and come to the right conclusion that real
love and respectable women are much more within their
means than sham love and disreputable women. A
charming companion, who is at the same time a sweet
mistress and counsellor, a careful housekeeper and a
devoted wife, appears to them in her true light&mdash;the
best article in the market. Besides, they realize that
the man who is married has a social advantage over the
one who is not. The man who marries a girl of his own
society can now explain that he married her simply
because he loved her, without thinking that he has to
apologize for his action by mentioning what a good
stroke of business he has made.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Most men of the preceding generation avoided matrimony
as they would have avoided ridicule. The part
of husband and father struck them as unpleasant and too
<i>petit bourgeois</i>. Literature and the drama helped to fill
them with this notion; but now literature and the
drama are getting optimistic. We are getting over the
period of problem novels and plays, in which all the
morbid diseases of the heart were dissected. The
heroes of novels and plays begin to get married without
ceasing to be interesting, and the result is that the
present generation of France is getting more healthy
and more cheerful. This is most hopeful for France,
for the regeneration seems to take place in every class
of society. The friends of France will rejoice in this
evolution. I have always maintained, and still maintain,
that it is the educational system that explains the
prosperity of the Anglo-Saxon race, and that absolute
freedom for men to marry the women they love
explains its strength and its marvellous vitality.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>LOVE WITH WHITE HAIR</h3>


<p>Don't smile. If there is a love absolutely beautiful,
almost holy, it is love with white hair. If conjugal
tenderness deserves at all the name of love, it is at that
time of life when it becomes idealized and purified. If
two hearts can, in this world, beat in perfect unison, it
is the two hearts of old married couples united by a
whole life of tender intimacy. Love, in getting old,
does not become repulsive&mdash;like an old beau, who, with
dyed hair and moustache perfumed, thinks he can pass
for a handsome young man. In those kisses, which are
no longer given on the lips, but, with sweet reverence,
are discreetly given on the hand or on the forehead, in
the effusions of an old married couple, I see the most
profound and most holy of human tenderness.</p>

<p>They are no more lovers, but they are friends who
cannot for a single moment forget that they were lovers,
and who spend the winter of their lives in sweet remembrance
of the beautiful spring, the glorious summer, and
the restful, sober autumn they enjoyed together.</p>

<p>This final sublime love may be rare, but it does exist;
it is the reward of concessions made and of faults<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
forgiven; the reward of cheerfulness, the result of long
years spent together, sharing the same joys, the same
sorrows, and the same dreams. Tactful, refined, they
are at this very moment as thoughtful as they ever
were before. Each one is the first consideration in the
world to the other. The refinement of their courtesy
to each other is a constant avowal of the esteem they
feel; in their old intimacy they keep the same scruples,
the same delicacy as they did in the first days of their
married life. They do not call each other 'love,'
'darling,' not even, perhaps, by their Christian names,
but 'dear friend'&mdash;and they lay on 'dear' an emphasis
that shows how sincere the expression is.</p>

<p>I tell you that there is no love in which you can find
as much poetry as in the love of those dear couples who
for forty or fifty years have walked side by side loving,
respecting, helping each other, dreaming, praying,
suffering together, and whose actions, words, and
thoughts have each added an item to that treasure
which they can now count piece by piece. This long
community of hearts, this habit of sharing everything,
has even established between them a physical likeness
which would almost cause you to take them for brother
and sister rather than for man and wife.</p>

<p>And how children do love these dear old couples! how
they feel attracted toward them! There is a wonderful
affinity between very old people and very young
children. Both are alike in many ways: the former
have lost their strength, the latter have not yet got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
theirs. The world goes in a circle, and at the end of
his career the old man meets the child. They have
sympathy for each other, they understand each other,
and the past and the future are the best of friends.
Old people play with children with their hearts and
souls in absolute earnest, without any of those signs
of condescension which children are so quick to detect
and to resent; and I am not prepared to say that the
young children enjoy the play more keenly than do
the old ones.</p>

<p>Oh, if people would early prepare to become old,
what pleasures would be kept in store for them!</p>

<p>In the peaceful winter of a well-spent life, love with
white hair is an evening prayer that soars to the abode
of the seraphs.</p>

<h2>RAMBLES EVERYWHERE<br /><br /></h2>


<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>LITTLE MAXIMS FOR EVERYDAY USE</h3>


<p>It would do most of us a great deal of good to always
keep in mind, or to be now and then reminded of it,
lest we should forget it, that, when we are gone, the
earth will not stop, but will continue her course around
the sun. No one is indispensable in this world.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>In order to be successful, the cruet-stand should be
used with a great deal of discretion: a little salt always,
never any pepper, vinegar very sparingly, and oil always
in plenty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Never in your dealings with a man let him suppose
that you take him for a fool. If he is not one, he will
appreciate your consideration; and if he is one, he will
go about singing your praises. Either way, you will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
probably win; at any rate, you can't lose, and that's
something.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>When you have seen a man enjoying himself telling
you a story, never tell him that you have heard that
story before, and, above all, never tell him that you
know a much better version of it, and proceed with it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Remember that the acknowledged best conversationalists
are those who have the reputation of being good
listeners. You will be called brilliant according to the
way in which you will give others a chance to shine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>People who tell you all the good things that are said
of you teach you nothing new. Listen to criticism,
especially that which is fair and kind; then you may
learn something and profit by it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>When there is something nasty said about you in a
newspaper, you never run the slightest risk of not seeing
it. There is always a friend, even at the Antipodes,
who will post it to you, well marked in blue pencil at
the four corners. He takes an interest in you, and
feels that the paragraph may not do you any harm in
the way of antidote. It doesn't.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>When you hear that a man has taken such and such
a resolution, take it for granted, when you feel ready to
criticise him, that you are not the only person in the
world who knows what he is about.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The most valuable gift of nature to man is not
talent, not even genius, but temperament and character.
If you have both talent and character, the world will
belong to you, if you succeed in making talent the
servant, and not the master, of your character.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The successful man is not the one who seeks opportunities,
but the one who knows how to seize them by
the forelock when they present themselves. The great
diplomatist is not the one who creates events, but the one
who foresees them and knows best how to profit by them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>A man may be very clever without being very successful.
This happens when he has more talent than
character; but when a man is very successful, never be
jealous of him, for you may take it for absolutely granted
that he possesses qualities which account for his success.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Envy is the worst of evils, the one that pays least,
because it never excites pity in the breast of anyone,
and because it causes you to waste lots of time concerning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
yourself about other people's business instead of
spending it all minding your own.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Watch your children most carefully, for when they
are ten or twelve years of age you may detect in them
signs of defects, or even vices, which, if developed,
instead of checked at once, may prove to be their
ruin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />

<p>The key to success in life is the knowledge of value
of all things.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>It often requires a head more solidly screwed on the
shoulders to bear a great success than to stand a great
misfortune.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/i_acorn.png" width="35" height="45" alt="" title="" />

<p>The knowledge of the most insignificant thing is
worth having.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>DO THE BEST WITH THE HAND YOU HAVE</h3>


<p>It would be absurd to say that there is no such thing
as luck. Of course, there is luck, and fortunate is the
man who knows how to seize it at once by the forelock.</p>

<p>For instance, it is luck to be born handsome, strong,
and healthy; it is luck to be born rich, or of generous
parents who spend a little fortune in giving you a first-class
education.</p>

<p>What is absurd, however, is to say that you are
always unlucky. You cannot always be unlucky any
more than you can always be lucky. When a man
says to you, 'I am pursued by bad luck,' or, 'This is
my usual bad luck,' you know that he is lazy, quarrelsome,
unreliable, foolish, or a drunkard.</p>

<p>You may be unlucky at piquet a whole evening&mdash;even,
though seldom, a whole week; but if you go on playing
a whole year every day, you will find that, out of
365 games, you have won about 180 and lost about
180. I take it for granted, of course, that you are as
good a player as your opponent.</p>

<p>There is no more constant luck or constant bad luck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
in life than there is at cards, but there is such a thing
as good playing with either a good or bad hand, and in
life such a thing as making the best of fortunate and
unfortunate occurrences. A man is bound to have his
chance, and his 'luck' consists in knowing how to avail
himself of it.</p>

<p>Practically every officer has had a chance to distinguish
himself one way or the other, and therefore
to be noticed by his chiefs and obtain promotion.
Every artist has seen something which may reveal his
talent, his genius, if he has any. Every good actor is
bound to come across a part which may make his
fortune.</p>

<p>The same may be said of literary men and journalists.
Every man in business, if he keeps a sharp look-out, has
a chance for a good investment that will be the nucleus
of his fortune if he knows how to watch and nurse it
carefully. What most men call bad luck is not that
chance does not present itself to them, but simply that
they let it go by and miss it.</p>

<p>If you want to be lucky in life, force luck and
make it yourself. Believe in yourself, and others will
believe in you.</p>

<p>Rise early, be punctual, reliable, honest, economical,
industrious, and persevering, and, take my word for it,
you will be lucky&mdash;more lucky than you have any
idea of.</p>

<p>Never admit that you have failed, that you have been
beaten; if you are down, get up again and fight on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Frequent good company, be sober, constantly take
advice, and refrain from giving any until you have been
asked for it. Be cheerful, amiable, and obliging. Do
not show anxiety to be paid for any good turn you may
have the chance of doing to others. When you have
discovered who your real friends are, be true to them,
stick to them through thick and thin.</p>

<p>Do not waste time regretting what is lost, but
prepare yourself for the next deal. Forget injuries at
once; never air your grievances; keep your own secrets
as well as other people's; get determined to succeed,
and let no one, no consideration whatever, divert you
from the road that leads to the goal; let the dogs bark
and pass on. According to the way you behave in life,
you will be your greatest friend or your bitterest enemy.
There is no more 'luck' than that in the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>BEWARE OF THE FINISHING TOUCH</h3>


<p>'Leave well enough alone,' as the English say, is a
piece of advice which may be followed with benefit in
many circumstances of life.</p>

<p>How many excellent pictures have been spoiled by
the finishing touch! How often have I heard art
critics, after examining a beautiful portrait, exclaim,
'H'm, l&eacute;ch&eacute;!' Well, I cannot translate that French
art expression better than by 'Too much retouched&mdash;too
well finished!' This is a fault commonly found in
women's portraits.</p>

<p>How many fortunes have been lost because people,
instead of being satisfied with reasonable profits, waited
for stocks to go still higher, and got caught in a financial
crash!</p>

<p>Even in literature I see sad results, when authors
follow too closely that principle laid down by Boileau
for the elaboration of style: 'Polish and repolish it
incessantly.'</p>

<p>Alas! how many stilted lines are due to the too
strict obedience to this advice! What is too well
finished often becomes far-fetched and unnatural.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>How many sauces have been spoiled by cooks trying
to improve what was already very good!</p>

<p>How many wings have been singed for not knowing
how to keep at a respectful distance from the fire or the
light!</p>

<p>No doubt there is such a thing as perfection; but
who is perfect and what is perfect in this world, except
that ineffable lady who, some weeks ago, took me
severely to task for having written an article in which
I advised my readers to be good, but not to overdo
it?</p>

<p>The firmaments are perfect, some flowers are perfect,
but these are not the work of man. Nature herself
seems to have divided her gifts so as to have no absolute
perfection in her creatures. The nightingale has song,
but no plumage; the peacock has plumage, but his
voice makes you stop your ears.</p>

<p>And the women! Well, yes, the women&mdash;let us speak
of them.</p>

<p>Which of us, my dear fellow-men, has not admired a
woman of ours whose toilet was finished? We thought
she looked beautiful then, we admired her, and we put
on our gloves proudly, saying:</p>

<p>'She is coming.' Yet she did not come. True,
her hat was on and fixed when we saw her, and we
thought that she was ready. Not a bit of it. She
was not.</p>

<p>After she has finished dressing, and is absolutely
ready to go out, she will begin to fret and potter about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
in her room for another hour. She goes from looking-glass
to looking-glass. That is the time when she
thinks of the finishing touches.</p>

<p>She pulls her hat a little more to the right, then a
little more to the left, in order to ascertain how that
hat can be improved. She touches and retouches her
hair.</p>

<p>Her complexion is beautiful, a natural rosy pink, for
which she ought to return thanks, all day long, to the
most generous and kind Nature who gave it to her.
But, at the last moment, she thinks that this, too,
might be improved.</p>

<p>So she rubs her cheeks and puts more powder on
them. The rubbing makes her cheeks so red that she
has to subdue the colour. She works and works, and
now takes it into her head that, being warm, her nose
must be shining.</p>

<p>She takes the puff and puts powder on it. An hour
before she was a woman who, in your eyes at all events,
could not very well be improved.</p>

<p>Now she is ready, and emerges from her apartment.
Her hair is undone behind and ruffed in front, her hat
is too straight, and her face looks made-up. The
rubbing has changed her lovely pink complexion into a
sort of theatrical purple red.</p>

<p>You feel for her, because, being very proud of her
complexion, you do not want your friends&mdash;you
do not want anybody&mdash;to say: 'Oh, she is made-up.'
And you own that she looks it, and altogether she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
does not look half so well as she did when she had
finished dressing, and had not begun the finishing
touches.</p>

<p>Beware, ladies! Many a most beautiful woman has
been spoiled by the finishing touches.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE SELFISHNESS OF SORROW</h3>


<p>Real sorrow is no more expressed by the correctness of
a mourning attire and the despair written on a face than
true religious fervour is expressed by the grimaces that
are made at prayer-time.</p>

<p>Just as we are told in the Gospel to look cheerful and
not to frown and make faces when we pray, just so, I
believe, those who have gone before us would advise us
not to advertise the sorrow we feel at their loss, but
keep it in restraint, and not surround ourselves, and
especially not compel those who are living with us to be
surrounded, with gloom.</p>

<p>The outward signs of sorrow are often exaggerated and
not uncommonly nothing but acts of selfishness. The
memory of the departed is better respected by control
over the most sincere sorrow, and children, young ones
especially, who cannot at their age realize the loss they
have sustained, have a right to expect to be brought up
in that cheerfulness which is the very keynote of the
education of children.</p>

<p>The real heroine is the woman who leaves her grief
in her private apartments and appears smiling and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
cheerful before her children. The best way to serve the
dead is to live for the living. There is no courage in
the display of sorrow; there is heroism in the control
of it.</p>

<p>Great hearts understand this so well that many of
them, like the late Henry Ward Beecher, desire in their
wills that none of their relatives should wear mourning
at their death. There is a great difference between
being in mourning and being in black, and I often
suspect that the more in black a person is the less in
mourning he or she is.</p>

<p>To be able to attend minutely to all the details of
a most correct mourning attire almost shows signs of
recovery from the depth of the sorrow.</p>

<p>But even when our sorrow is deeply felt and perfectly
sincere is it not an act of selfishness on our part to
impose it, to intrude it, on others&mdash;even on our nearest
relatives?</p>

<p>I admire the Quaker who, quietly, without attracting
the attention of anyone at table, silently says grace
before taking his meal.</p>

<p>How favourably he compares with the host who
invites every one of his guests to bend their heads, and
to listen to him while he delivers a long recital of all
the favours he has received from a merciful God, and
of all the favours he expects to receive in the future!</p>

<p>The first is a Christian, the second a conceited
Pharisee. There is as much selfishness in an exaggerated
display of sorrow as there is in any act that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
is indulged in in order to more or less command admiration.</p>

<p>The truly brave and courageous people are modest in
their countenance; the truly religious are tolerant and
forgiving; the truly great are forbearing, simple, and
unaffected; the truly sorrowful remember that their
griefs are personal; before strangers they are natural
and even cheerful, and before their children they are
careful to appear with cheerful and smiling faces.</p>

<p>After all, the greatest virtue, the greatest act of unselfishness,
is self-control. Sorrow gives man the best
opportunity for the display of this virtue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE RIGHT OF CHANGING ONE'S MIND</h3>


<p>A woman's prerogative, it is said, is the right of changing
her mind. How is it that she so rarely avails herself
of it when she is wrong?</p>

<p>It should be the prerogative of a man also.
'What is a mugwump?' once asked an American of a
Democrat. 'It's a Republican who becomes a Democrat,'
was the answer. 'But when a Democrat becomes a
Republican, what do you call him?' 'Oh, a d&mdash;&mdash; fool!'
quickly rejoined the Democrat.</p>

<p>We forgive people for changing their opinions only
when they do so to espouse our views, otherwise they
are, in our eyes, fools, scoundrels, renegades, and
traitors.</p>

<p>To my mind the most dignified, praiseworthy, manly
act of a man is to change his opinions the moment he
has become persuaded that they are wrong. To acknowledge
to be in the wrong is an act of magnanimity. To
persist in holding views that one knows to be wrong is
an act of cowardice. To try to impose them on others
is an act of indelicacy. The successful man is the
opportunist who does what he thinks to be right at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
moment, whatever views he may have held on the
subject before.</p>

<p>When, in full Parliament, Victor Hugo and Lamartine
declared that they ceased to be Royalists, and immediately
went to take their seats on the Opposition benches, their
honesty and manliness deserved the applause they
received.</p>

<p>Gladstone, who died the greatest leader of the Liberal
party, began his political life as a Tory Member of
Parliament. Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield, who for
years was the chief of the Tory party, began his public
career as Radical member for Maidstone.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, to-day practically the
leader of the Conservative party, not only was an
advanced Radical, but a Republican. Up to about
eighteen years ago, the comic papers never failed to
represent him with a Phrygian cap on.</p>

<p>Every man can be mistaken in politics as well as in
science, just as he can for a long time be mistaken in
his friends.</p>

<p>The more you study, the more independence of mind
you acquire. Events take a new aspect, and strike you
in a different light. With age, judgment becomes
more sober: you weigh more carefully the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons
</i>of all questions, and you often arrive at the conclusion
that what you honestly believed to be right is absolutely
wrong. And it is your duty to abide by your conclusions.</p>

<p>The greatest crimes in history were committed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
irreconcilable men who lacked moral courage and dared
not admit that they were not infallible. Philip II. of
Spain was one.</p>

<p>That irreconcilable Imperialist, M. Paul de Cassagnac,
wrote the other day: 'When a statesman, a leader of
men, perceives that he has made a mistake, he has only
one thing left for him to do: disappear altogether from
the scene, for, having deceived himself, he has been
guilty of deceiving others.'</p>

<p>The aim of man&mdash;of the leader of men especially&mdash;is
to seek truth at any price.</p>

<p>Some men proudly say at the top of their voices: 'I
swear by the faith of my ancestors, what I thought
at twenty I think now. I have never changed my
opinions, and, with God's help, will never change them.'</p>

<p>Those men believe themselves to be heroes; they are
asses, and if they are leaders of men, they are most
dangerous asses.</p>

<p>To live and learn should be the object of every intelligent
man whose eyes are not blinded by conceit or
obstinacy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>WHAT WE OWE TO CHANCE</h3>


<p>Pascal once said that if Cleopatra's nose had been half
an inch shorter the face of the world would have been
changed. If we read history, or even only use our own
recollections, we can get up an interesting and sometimes
amusing record of more or less important events
which are entirely due to chance or most insignificant
incidents.</p>

<p>To begin with my noble self. On August 30, 1872,
I went to the St. Lazare station in Paris to catch a
train to Versailles. At the foot of the stairs I met a
friend whom I had not seen for a long time. He took
me to the caf&eacute;, and there, over a cup of coffee, we
chatted for half an hour. I missed my train; but fortunately
for me I did, for that train which I was to
have caught was a total wreck, and thirty lives were
lost in the accident.</p>

<p>A lady whom I knew many years ago once eloped
with a young man she had fallen in love with. Now,
this was very wicked, because she was married. It was
on a cold December day. When both arrived at the
hotel where they were going to stay, they found no fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
in their apartment, and ordered one to be made at once.
While this was going on they both caught a cold, and
were seized with an endless fit of sneezing. They
thought that they looked so ridiculous&mdash;well, the lady
did, at any rate&mdash;that she ordered her trunk to be
taken to the station immediately. She caught the next
train to Paris, and never did I hear that she was guilty
of any escapade ever after. But for that fire that was
not lit, all would have been lost.</p>

<p>At the inquest which a few days ago was held over
the body of Mrs. Gore, the American lady who was
shot accidentally while in the room of her Russian
friend, it was discovered that the bullet had struck the
eye without even grazing the eyelid. The experts came
to the conclusion that if she had been murdered, or had
committed suicide, she would have blinked, and her
eyelids would have been touched by the bullet. But
for this marvellous occurrence, the young Russian would
have been tried for murder, and perhaps found guilty.</p>

<p>An Australian of my acquaintance some years ago
wrote to his broker ordering him to sell 500 shares in
the Broken Hill Mining Company. The servant to
whom the letter was given mislaid it, and only screwed
up his courage to tell his master two days later. In the
meantime the shares had gone up, and, so seeing, the
Australian waited a little longer before selling. Then
came the boom. Two months after the day on which
he had ordered his broker to sell the 500 shares at 40s.
apiece these shares were worth &pound;96. He sold, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
through the carelessness of his servant became a rich
man. This is luck, if you like.</p>

<p>The late Edmond About, the famous French novelist,
came out first of the Normale Sup&eacute;rieure School. As
such he was entitled to be sent to the French school at
Athens for two years before being appointed professor
in some French Faculty. About had a humorous turn
of mind. Instead of studying ancient Greece at Athens,
he studied the modern Greeks. After his two years he
returned with the manuscripts of two books, 'Contemporary
Greece' and 'The Mountain King,' which
were such successes that he immediately resigned his
professorship to devote his time to literature. If,
instead of coming out first, he had come out second, he
would never have been sent to Athens, and About
would probably have spent his life as a learned Professor
of Greek or Latin at one of our Universities.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>WE NEEDN'T GET OLD</h3>


<p>'When my next birthday comes,' once said to me
Oliver Wendell Holmes, 'I shall be eighty years young.'
And he looked it&mdash;young, cheerful, with a kind, merry
twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>'And,' I said to him, 'to what in particular do you
attribute your youth? To good health and careful
living, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Well, yes,' he replied, 'to a certain extent, but
chiefly to a cheerful disposition and invariable contentment,
in every period of my life, with what I was. I
have never felt the pangs of ambition.'</p>

<p>'You needn't,' I remarked. 'The most ambitious
man would have been content with being what you
have been&mdash;what you are.'</p>

<p>'Happiness, which has contentment for its invariable
cause, is within the reach of practically everyone,' the
amiable doctor asserted. 'It is restlessness, ambition,
discontent, and disquietude that make us grow old prematurely
by carving wrinkles on our faces. Wrinkles
do not appear on faces that have constantly smiled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Smiling is the best possible massage. Contentment is
the Fountain of Youth.'</p>

<p>That same evening he was the guest at a banquet
given by a Boston club, to which I had been kindly
invited. When he rose to make a speech, they cheered
and applauded to the echo. His face was radiant,
beautiful. After he sat down, I said to him:</p>

<p>'Are you not tired of cheers and applause, after all
these years of triumphs?'</p>

<p>'No,' he replied; 'they never cheer loud enough, they
never applaud long enough to please me.'</p>

<p>Oliver Wendell Holmes was right; he had found the
key to happiness.</p>

<p>The philosophers of all ages have deservedly condemned
that universal discontent and disquietude which
runs through every rank of society and degree of life as
one of the bitterest reproaches of human nature, as
well as the highest affront to the Divine Author
of it.</p>

<p>If we look through the whole creation, and remark
the progressive scale of beings as they rise into perfection,
we shall perceive, to our own shame, that every one
seems satisfied with that share of life that has been
allotted to it, man alone excepted. He is pleased with
nothing, perpetually repining at the decrees of Providence,
and refusing to enjoy what he has, from a
ridiculous and never-ceasing desire for what he has not.</p>

<p>He is ambitious, restless, and unhappy, and instead
of dying young at eighty, dies old at forty. He misses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
happiness which is close at hand all his lifetime. The
object which is at a distance from him is always the
most inviting, and that possession the most valuable
which he cannot acquire. With the ideas of affluence
and grandeur he is apt to associate those of joy,
pleasure, and happiness.</p>

<p>Because riches and power may conduce to happiness,
he hastily concludes that they must do so. Alas!
pomp, splendour, and magnificence, which attend the
great, are visible to every eye, while the sorrows which
they feel escape our observation. Hence it arises that
almost every condition and circumstance of life is considered
preferable to our own, that we so often court
ruin and do our very best to be unhappy.</p>

<p>We complain when we ought to be thankful; we
weep when we ought to rejoice; we fidget and fret.
Instead of smiling, which keeps the cheeks stretched
and smooth, we frown, which keeps them contracted
and engraves wrinkles on them.</p>

<p>Instead of looking at the rosy side of things, which
makes the eyes clear and bright, we run after the
impossible or the unlikely to happen, which makes us
look gloomy. In short, I may say that old age is of
our own make, for youth is placed at our disposal for
ever and ever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE SECRET OF OLD AGE</h3>


<p>The organs of man are like the works of a clock. If
they are not used, they rust; and when, after a period
of rest, it is attempted to set them in motion again, the
chances are that the human machine will work badly, or
not at all.</p>

<p>Therefore, wind up your clock always and regularly,
and it will keep going. This does not apply only to
your bodily clock, but to your mental one as well.</p>

<p>Persons who work regularly, and, above all, in
moderation, especially those who maintain the activity
of their physical and mental faculties, live longer than
those who abandon active life at the approach of
old age.</p>

<p>Do not stop taking bodily exercise. Go on having
your walk and your ride; go on working steadily; go
on even having your little smoke, if you have always
been used to it, without ever abusing it&mdash;in fact, if your
constitution is good, forget that you are advancing in
age; go on living exactly as you have always lived, only
doing everything in more and more moderation. Busy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
people live much longer than idle ones. Sovereigns
who lead a very active life live long.</p>

<p>See the Pope! Moltke, Bismarck, Disraeli, Carlyle,
Victor Hugo, Gladstone, Ruskin, Littr&eacute;, Darwin, De
Lesseps, Renan, Pasteur&mdash;all great workers&mdash;died nearly
eighty or over eighty years of age.</p>

<p>It is not work, but overwork, that may kill; it is not
smoking, but inveterate smoking, that hurts; it is not
a little drinking that does any harm, but too much
indulgence in drink which kills.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who died only a short
time ago, was writing brilliant articles for the New
York <i>American</i> only a few days before her death;
maybe, she was writing one an hour before it.</p>

<p>Her death at the age of eighty-seven may furnish a
moral lesson to those who desire a long life. She
died in complete possession of her mental and physical
faculties.</p>

<p>At eighty-five, Gladstone was felling trees in his
garden and writing articles on Homer and theology
as a rest from his political labours. At eighty-two,
De Lesseps was riding three hours every day in the
Bois de Boulogne. At ninety-eight, Sidney Cooper was
exhibiting pictures at the Royal Academy.</p>

<p>Yes, so long as the human machine is kept well oiled
and regularly wound up, it goes; and not only do active
bodies and minds who go on working live long, but they
live happily and die peacefully, and they also make
happy all those who live with them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a lovely sight to see De Lesseps ride and drive
with a troop of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
The youngest and most boisterous member of the party
was the old gentleman, and all that band of joyous
youngsters adored him.</p>

<p>The man of healthy body and active mind, who
abandons work at fifty, even at sixty, prepares himself
for a life of mere vegetation.</p>

<p>Let him stop remunerative work, if he does not find
it congenial, and has enough or more than he wants to
live upon, but let him immediately trace out for himself
a programme of life that will enable him to keep his
body and mind active, or let him look out for dyspepsia,
gout, rheumatism, paralysis, stiffness of the joints, and
the gradual loss of his mental faculties.</p>

<p>'I am sorry to be getting an old man,' once remarked
Ferdinand de Lesseps, 'but what consoles me is the
thought that there is no other way of living a long
time.'</p>

<p>It is activity, it is work, that keeps you young,
healthy, cheerful, and happy; it is work&mdash;thrice
blessed work&mdash;that makes you feel that you are not a
useless piece of furniture in this world, and makes you
die with a smile on your face. Work, work again, work
always!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>ADVICE ON LETTER-POSTING</h3>


<p>1. When you go out with the intention of posting a
letter, be sure you do not put it in your pocket, or the
odds are ten to one that you will return home with it.</p>

<p>2. Always address the envelope before you write a
letter.</p>

<p>3. If you write love-letters to two different women,
be careful to enclose the first one in its properly
addressed envelope before you begin writing the second
one, or Maria may receive the letter intended for Eliza,
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p>4. Do not apologize in your postscript for having
forgotten to stamp your letter. It might get you
found out.</p>

<p>5. If you have written an important letter, or one
containing money, put it in the letter-box yourself. If
anything wrong happens to it, you will have no one to
accuse or suspect.</p>

<p>6. When you send currency by post, do not let anyone
know it by having the letter registered. Money
stolen through the post has always been abstracted
from registered letters. I have never heard of one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
letter of mine not being delivered in Europe and in
America. People never take their chance. They never
open a letter unless they know there is money in it.
How can they know if you are careful in concealing
paper money under cover? Never label your letters,
'There is money in it.'</p>

<p>7. If you post a letter, which you do not want anybody
to read except the person to whom it is addressed,
do not forget to write your name and address on the back
of the envelope, so that, if not delivered, or mislaid, it
may be returned to you unopened.</p>

<p>8. If you want an important letter to be delivered in
New York at a determined time, take my advice: Post
that letter, in the city, twenty-four hours before the
said determined time.</p>

<p>9. Never, or very seldom, in some exceptional cases,
answer a letter by return post, even if the request be
made. Always take twenty-four hours for consideration.
Besides, it will give you the appearance of being a very
busy man, which is always a splendid advertisement.</p>

<p>10. When you enclose a bill or a cheque in a letter,
pin it to the letter, that it may not drop when the
envelope is opened, and before posting it feel the letter-box
inside to see that it is not choked.</p>

<p>11. If you write a letter of a private nature&mdash;words
of love that you would be sorry for everyone to read
except the lady you are addressing, put a blank sheet
of notepaper around the letter. Most envelopes are
transparent, and may disclose your secrets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>12. Always read twice the address you have written
on your envelopes. Apply the same process to your
letters; your time will not be wasted.</p>

<p>13. When you write to a friend, do not inquire about
his health and that of his family after your signature.
It would look like an afterthought.</p>

<p>14. Ladies, whose minds are full of afterthoughts,
generally write the most important part of their letters
in the postscript. I once received a letter, in a woman's
handwriting, the signature of which was unknown to
me. At the end of sixteen pages of pretty prattle
there was a postscript: 'You will see by my new signature
that I am married.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>ON PARASITES</h3>


<p>Steer clear once for all of useless people and parasites
of all sorts&mdash;bores, who make you waste your time;
indelicate people, who borrow money when they do not
know whether they will be able to return it; swindlers,
who know perfectly well they will never pay you back
a penny. Elbow your way out of all those frauds&mdash;poseurs,
spongers, leeches, fleas, and bugs&mdash;who try to
fasten themselves to you.</p>

<p>Be generous, and help a friend in need; devote a
reasonable portion of your income to the hospitals,
charitable institutions, and the sufferers from public
calamities; after that, attend to yourself and to all
those who live around you and depend on you for their
comfort and happiness.</p>

<p>Bang your door in the face of people who, in your
hour of success, come to treat you with a few patronizing
sneers in order to take down your pride. Kick down
your stairs, even if you live on the tenth floor, the man
with an alcoholic breath who calls to tell you that, as
you are a fortunate man, it is your duty, and should be
your pleasure, to help those who have no luck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>Life is too short to allow you to play the part of a
friend to the whole human race. Concern yourself
about interesting and deserving people; cultivate the
friendship of pleasant men and women, who brighten
up your life, and that of useful ones, who may occasionally
give you the lift you deserve. Attend to your
business; carefully watch over the interests of those
who have a right to expect you to keep them in comfort,
and dismiss the rest, even from your thoughts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>ADVICE-GIVING</h3>


<p>Advice is a piece of luxury thoroughly enjoyed by the
one who gives it. If you want to be popular with your
friends, do them all the good turns you can. Lend them
your money if you have a surplus to spare, and which
you can comfortably make up your mind to the loss of,
but give them advice when they ask you for it.</p>

<p>People who are lavish of advice are seldom guilty of
any other act of generosity. If, however, you cannot
resist the temptation of advice-giving, be sure, at least,
that you give it in time. People who keep on saying
to their friends, 'I told you so,' are the most aggravating
bores in the world.</p>

<p>If a little boy wants to venture on a dangerous piece
of ice, give him a warning and advise him not to go,
but if he disregards your advice and falls into a hole,
rescue him and wait until he is quite well again before
you say to him, 'I told you so.'</p>

<p>Of all your best friends, your wife is the last person
to whom you should say, 'I told you so.' These four
words have killed happiness in matrimonial life more
than any number of blasphemous words put together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>A wife forgives a few hot words uttered in moments
of bad temper or passion, but there is something cold,
sneering, provoking, blighting, assertive, presumptive in
'I told you so,' which gives you an unbearable air of
superiority and self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>When you are already upset, dissatisfied with yourself,
ready to take your revenge out of anyone who
takes advantage of your awkward and unenviable
position, 'I told you so' is the drop that causes the cup
to overflow.</p>

<p>The amateur advice-giver is a nuisance, a fidget, a
kill-joy, and an unmitigated bore. Men avoid him,
women despise him, and children mind him until he is
out of sight. To the latter he sets up as a model, and
always begins his admonitions with the inevitable
'When I was a boy.' Then they know what is coming,
and giggle&mdash;when they do not wink.</p>

<p>Advice given by old folks to children sows as much
valuable seed as do sermons on congregations, with this
difference to the advantage of congregations, that they
can close their eyes during a sermon in order to take it
in better, whereas children cannot do the same for fear
of being called rude and of being punished for it.</p>

<p>Among other advice-givers whom I have in my mind's
eye, I remember the one who calls on me the day after I
have given a lecture in order to make suggestions which
'I might use with advantage the next time I give this
lecture.' Also the one who calls to advise me to introduce
a 'reminiscence of his,' which I might use on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
platform to illustrate a point, and which 'reminiscence
of his' I have heard for twenty years and know to be
part of a classic on the subject.</p>

<p>The chairman who, before I go on the platform,
advises me how to use my voice in order to be well heard
by all the members of the audience, a piece of advice
which I thoroughly appreciate, as I have lectured only
3,000 times&mdash;well, over 2,500 times, to be perfectly
exact.</p>

<p>I even remember one who criticised my pronunciation
of a French word in my lecture, and suggested his as an
improvement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>ON HOLIDAYS</h3>


<p>Holidays are an institution established to keep you
reminded every year that one is really happy and comfortable
at home only. Oh! the board and lodging,
advertised comfortable and moderate, which you leave
with pleasure because the board was the bed! Oh! the
little house with creepers from which you 'flee' because
you discover that the creepers are inside! And the
sofas and chairs stuffed with the pebbles from the beach,
and the bad cooking, and the smiles of the head waiter,
of the waiters, of the chambermaid, of the hall porter,
of the baggage porter, all of whom have to be tipped!
And the extras on the bill! How you rub your hands
with delight when at last you are in the train on the
way to that dear home of yours, where you are going
to sleep in your lovely bed, sit on your comfortable
chairs, stretch on your soft sofa, eat the appetizing,
simple, and healthy meals of your good cook, where, on
a rainy day, you will go and take down a favourite
book from the shelves of your library; where you are
going to be all the time surrounded by your own dear
belongings, able to look at your pictures, at your china;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
where you are going to put again in their usual places
the photographs of all your friends; in fact, where you
are going to live once more, after an interval necessary
to your health, perhaps, through the rest from work
and the change of air it has afforded you, but for all
that an interval, nothing but an interval in life.</p>

<p>The only enjoyable holidays that I know are either
those spent in a house of your own which you may
possess in the country or by the sea, or those spent in
travelling, making the acquaintance of new, interesting
and picturesque countries; but these holidays are only
within the reach of the privileged few.</p>

<p>Very often loving couples, fearing they should get too
much accustomed to each other, part for a few days,
just for the sake, epicures that they are, of experiencing
the ineffable joy of meeting again and of proving to
themselves that each one is absolutely indispensable to
the other&mdash;a fact which, although they may be well
aware of it, is always pleasant to be reminded of. The
holidays are to the home what the parting for a few
days is to the loving couples&mdash;a reminder of the priceless
treasure which you possess, and which you do not
always sufficiently appreciate.</p>

<p>Think of your children, too, especially of those
young boys who are boarders at school or college and
can only know the joys of home life during their
holidays. How they would prefer going to their own
homes, playing with their own things, looking after
their animals, to being trotted out and taken to a hotel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
where children are not tolerated to do this or allowed
to do that! When parents live in a house of their own,
and in the country, it is absolutely wicked of them not
to let their children enjoy their holidays at home.
They should remember that if their children at school
long for holidays, it is not because they are tired of
their work, it is because they are homesick.</p>

<p>And young people just married always think that
the best way of beginning the matrimonial journey
is to have a holiday and travel, although, maybe, the
thoughtful bridegroom has prepared a delightful nest
for his bride.</p>

<p>'Where should I spend my honeymoon?' I have often
been asked by young men not rich enough to go and
spend it in the expensive resorts. I have invariably
answered, 'Go home and spend it there, you idiot.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>VARIOUS CRITICISMS ON CREATION</h3>


<p>I shall never forget the dry way and pitiful manner in
which Robert Louis Stevenson passed a funeral oration
on Matthew Arnold. It was on a Sunday evening, in
the early spring of 1888, at a reception given at the
house of Edmund Clarence Stedman, whose poetry and
scholarly attainments excite as much admiration as
his warm heart excites love in those who, like myself,
can boast of his friendship. Someone entered and
created consternation by announcing that a cablegram
had just reached New York with the news that Matthew
Arnold was dead. 'Poor Matthew!' said Stevenson,
lifting his eyes with an air of deep compassion; 'heaven
won't please him!'</p>

<p>And it is true that on many occasions that great
English writer had hinted that if the work of the
Creation had been given to him to undertake, it would
have proved more successful than it has been. For
that matter, many philosophers of a more or less
cynical turn of mind have criticised the work of Creation.</p>

<p>Voltaire said that if he had been Jehovah 'he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
not have chosen the Jews.' My late friend, Colonel
Robert G. Ingersoll, a Voltairian to the core, said that
if he had been consulted 'he would have made health,
not disease, catching.' Ninon de Lenclos, the veriest
woman that ever lived, said that, had she been invited
to give an opinion, 'she would have suggested that
women's wrinkles be placed under their feet.'</p>

<p>'Everything is for the best in the best of worlds!'
exclaims Dr. Pangloss in Voltaire's famous novel,
'Candide,' but few people are as satisfied with the
world as that amiable philosopher. There are people
who are even dissatisfied with our anatomy, and who
declare that man's leg would be much safer and would
run much less risk of being broken if the calf had been
placed in front of it instead of behind. Some go as
far as to say that man is the worst handicapped animal
of creation&mdash;that he should have been made as strong as
the horse, able to run like the stag, to fly like the lark,
to swim and dive like the fish, to have a keen sense of
smell like the dog, and one of sight like the eagle. Not
only that, but that man is the most stupid of all, the
most cruel, the most inconsistent, the most ungrateful,
the most rapacious, the only animal who does not know
when he has had enough to eat and to drink, the only
one who kills the fellow-members of his species, the
only one who is not always a good husband and a good
father.</p>

<p>'Man, the masterpiece of creation, the king of the
universe!' they exclaim. 'Nonsense!' There is hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
an animal that he dares look straight in the face and
fight. No; he hides behind a rock, and, with an
engine of destruction, he kills at a distance animals
who have no other means of defence than those given
them by nature, the coward!</p>

<p>There is not the slightest doubt that the genius of
man has to reveal itself in the discovery of all that may
remedy the disadvantages under which he finds himself
placed. Boats, railways, automobiles, balloons, steam,
electricity, and what not, have been invented, and are
used to cover his deficiencies. Poor man! he has to
resort to artificial means in every phase of life. Even
clothes he has to wear, as his body has not been provided
with either fur or feathers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>THE HUMOURS OF THE INCOME-TAX</h3>

<h3>(A WARNING)</h3>


<p>I have often heard Americans say that the future may
keep in store for them the paying of income-tax, and,
as a warning to them, I should like to let them know
how this tax is levied in England.</p>

<p>In theory the income-tax is the most just of taxes,
since it compels, or seems to compel, the people to contribute
to the maintenance of their country in proportion
to the income they possess. In reality this tax,
levied as it is in England, is little less than the revival
of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>And, first of all, let me point out a great injustice,
which I trust no Government will ever inflict on the
American people or any other, and which is this: The income
derived from property inherited, or any other which
the idlest man may enjoy without having to work for
it, is taxed exactly the same as the income which is
derived from work in business, profession, or any other
calling.</p>

<p>I maintain that if I have a private income of, say,
&pound;2,000, and my work brings me in another &pound;2,000, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
first income ought to be taxed much more heavily than
the second.</p>

<p>I maintain that if a man enjoys a private income,
and does no work for the community in return for the
privilege of the wealth he possesses, he ought to pay a
larger percentage than the man who has to work for
every shilling which he amasses during the year.</p>

<p>But this is discussing, and in this article I only wish
to show how the free-born Briton is treated in the
matter of income-tax.</p>

<p>A fact not altogether free from humour is that the
salary of the English tax-collector is a percentage of
what he can extract from the tax-payer.</p>

<p>He asks you to send him the amount of your income,
and warns you that you will have to pay a penalty of
&pound;50 if you send him a false return. I have it on the
authority of Mr. W. S. Gilbert that every Englishman
sends a false return and cheats his Government; but
now a good many men, I am sure, cannot cheat the
Government&mdash;those, for example, in receipt of a salary
from an official post, and many others whose incomes it
is easy to find out.</p>

<p>Of course, some cannot be found out; so that those
who cannot conceal their real and whole income have
got to pay for those who can.</p>

<p>A merchant sends his return, and values it at
&pound;10,000. The collector says to him, if he chooses to
do so: 'Your return cannot be right. I will charge
you on &pound;20,000. Of course, you can appeal.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>The merchant is obliged to lose a whole day to
attend the Court of Appeal, taking all his books with
him, in order to prove that the return he sent is
exact.</p>

<p>Very often he pays double what he owes, so as not to
have to let everybody know that his business is not as
flourishing as people think. But the most amusing side
of the whole thing is yet to be told.</p>

<p>If you sell meat in one shop and groceries in another,
and you make &pound;5,000 in the first shop and lose &pound;3,000
in the second, you must not suppose that you will be
charged on &pound;2,000, the difference between your profit
in the first business and the loss in the second. Not a
bit of it. The two businesses being distinct, you will
have to pay on the &pound;5,000 profit made in the first, and
bear your loss in the other as best you can.</p>

<p>As an illustration, I will give you a somewhat piquant
reminiscence. Many years ago I undertook to give
lectures in England under my own management. My
manager proved to be an incompetent idiot, and I lost
money.</p>

<p>When I declared my yearly income, I said to the
income-tax collector: 'My books brought me an income
of so much, but I lost so much on my lecture
tour; my income is the difference&mdash;that is, so much.'</p>

<p>'No,' he said; 'your books and your lectures are two
perfectly different things, and I must charge you on the
whole income you derived from the sale of your books.'</p>

<p>Then I was struck with a luminous idea, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
proved to me that I was better fitted to deal with the
English tax-collector than to manage a lecture tour.</p>

<p>'The two things are not at all distinct,' I replied;
'they are one and the same thing. I gave lectures for
the sole purpose of keeping my name before the public
and pushing the sale of my books.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' he exclaimed, 'you are right. In that case
you are entitled to deduct your loss from the profit.'</p>

<p>And this is how I got out of the difficulty&mdash;a little
incident which has made me proud of my business
abilities ever since.</p>

<p>I was in America last season to give lectures. Instead
of lecturing, I had to be in bed and in convalescence
for a month, then undergo an operation and stay in the
hospital for six weeks.</p>

<p>You may imagine the fine income I derived from my
last American tour. On my return to Europe, I passed
through London, and stopped there a week before
coming to Paris.</p>

<p>I found awaiting me a bill for about &pound;54, a percentage
on 'my profit of &pound;1,000 realized in America.'
Now, this was adding insult to injury. I have the greatest
respect for H.M. Edward VII., but I regret that his
officials should have resorted to such means to defray
the expenses of his Coronation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>HOW TO BE ENTERTAINING</h3>


<p>To know how to entertain people is a talent; but there
is one better, and which makes you still more popular
with your friends and acquaintances&mdash;it is that talent
which consists in drawing them out and allowing them
to entertain you.</p>

<p>I know very clever people, not exactly conceited or
assertive, but who have the objectionable knack of
gently sitting upon you. Their opinions are given with
an <i>ex cathedra</i> air that seems to exclude any appeal
against them.</p>

<p>Sometimes they tell anecdotes very well, and they
give you strings of them, each one bridged over to the
other by a 'That reminds me.' They laugh at their
anecdotes heartily, and invite you to do so with such a
suggestion as 'That's a good one, isn't it?'</p>

<p>You do laugh, and you hope for your reward, that
you will be able to tell a little anecdote yourself.
Sometimes they will cut you short and go on with
another; sometimes they will give you a chance, show
little signs of impatience while you give it, and never
laugh when you have finished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>Worse than that, they will occasionally say: 'Oh
yes,' on the tune of 'I have heard that one before,' or,
maybe, 'Why, I am the inventor of it myself.' I have
known such clever people and good anecdote tellers to
prove terrific bores.</p>

<p>Whether you are discussing a question or merely
spending a little time telling stories over a cup of coffee
and a couple of cigarettes, you like to be allowed to
prove alive, and the really entertaining people are
those who know how to make you enjoy yourself as well
as their company.</p>

<p>You are grateful to those friends who give you a
chance of shining yourself, and there are some who
know not only how to draw you out, but who
know how to do it to the extent of making you
brilliant.</p>

<p>Those who make you feel like an idiot are no better
than those who take you for one. Although they do not
do it on purpose, the result is exactly the same as if
they did. You find that kind of man in every walk of
life.</p>

<p>There is the savant who pours forth science by the
gallon and talks you deaf, dumb, and lame. There is
the other kind also. I once spent an hour talking on
philology with the greatest professor of the College of
France in Paris.</p>

<p>I know a little philology, but my knowledge of that
science compared to his is about in the proportion of
the length of my little finger to that of his whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
body, and he is over six feet. He put me so much at
my ease; he so many times asked me 'if I didn't
think that it was so,' that for the time being I really felt I
was something of a philologist myself. It was only after
I had left him that I realized that I had learned a great
deal from the famous master.</p>

<p>The nice people of the world are those who make you
feel satisfied with yourself. All the talkers, advice-givers,
assertive critics put together are not worth for
your good a considerate friend who gives you a little
praise, or a good, loving woman who, two or three times
a day, gives you a teaspoonful of admiration.</p>

<p>After all, the greatest reward for our humblest efforts
is appreciation, the greatest incentive is encouragement.
What makes us powerless to achieve anything are the
sneers of all the wet-blankets and kill-joys of this
world.</p>

<p>You do not make a child get on at school by calling
him a little idiot and telling him he will never do anything
in his life; you do not impart bravery into the
heart of a timid soldier by treating him as if he were
a coward.</p>

<p>If a horse is afraid of anything lying on the road,
don't whip him, don't use the spurs; pat him gently on
the neck and lead him near the object to make him
acquainted with it. Like that you will cure him of his
shyness.</p>

<p>Help men with encouragement, praise, and admiration.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>WHAT IS GENIUS?</h3>


<p>Genius is a form of madness. Early in the Christian
era, St. Augustine declared that there was no genius
without a touch of insanity. The human being who
is born without a grain of folly will never be a great
poet, a great novelist, a great painter or sculptor, a
great musician, or a great anything.</p>

<p>Unless you are erratic, irritable, full of fads, you need
not aspire to attain sublime heights. Homer, Shakespeare,
Raphael, Shelley, Wagner were lunatics. That
is why, to my mind, nothing is more absurd, preposterous,
than to go and poke one's nose into the
private life of geniuses. Let us admire the work that
their genius has left to us, without inquiring whether
they regularly came home to tea, and were attentive
fathers and faithful husbands. Do we not love Burns
and Shelley?</p>

<p>Certainly, if I had lived in their times and had a
marriageable daughter, I would have been careful to
see that she did not fall in love with either of them;
but what has that to do with their poetry and the
enjoyment of it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>To this very day, in the autumn of my life, I enjoy
the fables of dear old La Fontaine, and can't help
smiling when I am reminded that he was married, but
that he was separated from his wife. She lived in Lyons
and he in Paris. One day they persuaded him to go to
Lyons and 'make it up' with her.</p>

<p>He started. In those days the journey took five days
and five nights. On the eleventh day after his departure
he was back in Paris. 'Well,' they said to
him, 'is it all right?'</p>

<p>'I could not see her,' replied he, 'when I called at
her house. They told me that she had gone to Mass.'
So he came back.</p>

<p>I once criticised the acting of a well-known actress
before good folks, who said to me: 'Ah, but she is a
woman who leads an irreproachable life!' What do I
care about that? I am very glad to hear it, for the
sake of her husband and children; but I would rather
go and hear Miss So-and-so, who stirs my soul to its
very depth by her genius, although I am told, by
jealous people, no doubt, that she is not quite as good
as she should be.</p>

<p>I hear that Sarah Bernhardt travels with either a
lion, a bear, or a snake. Very well, that is her business.
She goes to a hotel with her menagerie, and does not
ask you to invite her to stay with you. Is that a
reason for not going to see her play Phedre, Tosca,
Fedora, or any other of her marvellous creations?</p>

<p>Wagner could not compose his operas unless he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
on a red plush robe and a helmet. What do I care if
this enabled him to write 'Lohengrin,' 'Tannh&auml;user,'
and the Trilogy?</p>

<p>One day Alexandre Dumas, a lunatic of the purest
water, called on Wagner. The latter kept him waiting
half an hour. Then he appeared dressed as Wotan.
'Excuse me, Master,' he said to Dumas, 'I am composing
a scene between the god and Brunnehilde.'</p>

<p>'Don't mention it, please,' replied Dumas, who, before
leaving, invited him to come and see him in Paris. A
few months later Wagner called on Dumas. The latter
kept him waiting a little, and then appeared with
nothing on but a Roman helmet and a shield.</p>

<p>'Excuse me, Maestro,' he said, 'I am writing a Roman
novel.' The two great geniuses or lunatics were quits.</p>

<p>I knew a great poet who could no more write good
poetry than he could fly unless he had blue paper.
Victor Hugo would have been a failure if he had not
been able always to be provided with very thick pens.</p>

<p>Balzac could write only on condition he was dressed
as a monk, had the shutters of the room closed, and the
lamps lighted. Alfred de Musset would compose his
immortal poetry only when under the influence of drink.
All lunatics, every one.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>NEW AND PIQUANT CRITICISM</h3>


<p>The Paris <i>Matin</i> has started a new kind of dramatic
criticism. The day after a play has been produced it
publishes a criticism of it by the author himself, or by
the manager of the theatre. This is as piquant as it is
novel, and if the French had the sense of humour as
keenly developed as the Americans, the result would be
highly diverting.</p>

<p>Just imagine a play by Mark Twain reviewed and
criticised the following morning in a paper by Mr.
Samuel L. Clemens!</p>

<p>Gentlemen of the American press, take the hint, if
you like.</p>

<p>This new kind of criticism is only a few days old, but
the readers of the <i>Matin</i> have taken to it kindly
already. Two well-known men have inaugurated it.
They are Pierre Wolff, the dramatist, and Antoine,
the actor and proprietor-manager of the Antoine
Theatre. Both give a very flattering account of their
plays: how beautifully they were acted, how well they
were received, and, after giving a short synopsis of
them, wind up with heartfelt thanks to the actors and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
actresses who appeared in them. Everybody is satisfied,
author, actors, managers, editor, who has attracted the
notice of the public, and the readers, who are amused
at the new idea, and do not care a jot what critics say
of the plays which they review.</p>

<p>Why should not books be reviewed in the same way?
Why should they not be reviewed and criticised by the
author or the publisher? I should prefer&mdash;by the
author.</p>

<p>I have never read a notice of any of my books, however
favourable, which I did not think I could have
done better myself, if I had had to write it.</p>

<p>Just imagine, if only for fun, a new novel (pronounced
'novell,' please) by Hall Caine reviewed by Mr. Hall
Caine; or one by Marie Corelli criticised by that
talented lady herself! I say, just think of it!</p>

<p>We might have the good-fortune to read something
in the following style: 'A new novel by myself
is one of those literary events which keep the world
breathless, in awful silence, for a long time before it
comes to pass. The first edition of 100,000 copies was
exhausted a week before the book appeared, but a
second edition of the same number will be ready in a
day or two. The story is wonderful, colossal, like
everything that comes from the pen of that author,
whose genius is as Shakespearian as his brow, which
even reminds one of that of&mdash;but perhaps it would be
profane to name.'</p>

<p>Or something interesting like this: 'His Majesty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the King and most members of the Royal Family
ordered copies of this book long before it was ready for
publication, and no doubt to-day, and for many days
following, there will be no other topic of conversation
than my book at Windsor Castle. I should like to call
the attention of the reading public&mdash;and who is it that
does not read me?&mdash;to the fact that this is the longest
book I have yet published. The public will also, I am
sure, forgive me for calling it my best. A mother's
last baby is always, in her eyes, her best.'</p>

<p>At all events, I salute the new criticism. It should
greatly add to the gaiety of nations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>ORIGINALITY IN LITERATURE</h3>


<p>There is very little originality in this world. Even
among the greatest thoughts expressed by famous
philosophers, there are very few that had not been
heard before in some form or other. It is the pithy
way in which they are expressed by such men as
La Rochefoucauld, La Bruy&egrave;re, and Balzac that made
the reputation of these great writers. The characteristics
of man and woman have always existed, just
as has their anatomy, and the dissector of the human
heart cannot invent anything new any more than the
dissector of the human body. We all know these
characteristics, but what we like is to see a philosopher
present them to us in a new shape.</p>

<p>Pascal says that the greatest compliment that can be
paid to a book, even to a thought, is the exclamation,
'I could have written that!' and 'I could have said
that!' In fact, the author whom we admire most is
the one who writes a book that we 'could' have written
ourselves. And we say 'bravo' when a philosopher
gives us a thought of our own, only better expressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
than we could have done it, or when he confirms an
opinion that we already held ourselves.</p>

<p>No; there is nothing original, not even the stories
that we hear and tell in our clubs. They have been
told before. I forget who said that there were only
thirty-five anecdotes in the world, seventeen of which
were unfit for ladies' ears.</p>

<p>Even the characters of fiction are not original. The
novelist is, as a rule, none but a portrait painter, possessed
of more or less originality and talent. Charles
Dickens said that there was not a single personage of
his novels whom he had not drawn from life. Thackeray
and Balzac, two observers of mankind of marvellous
ability, said the same. Racine borrowed of Sophocles
and Euripides, Moli&egrave;re of Plautus and Terence. Alexandre
Dumas chose his heroes from history, and regifted
them with life with his unequalled imagination.
George Eliot's personality remained a mystery for a
long time, but everybody knew that the author of
'Scenes of Clerical Life' was a native of Nuneaton,
or had lived long enough in that town to introduce
local characters who were recognised at once. The
<i>Dame aux Cam&eacute;lias</i>, the Camille of the American
stage, by Dumas, junr., was inspired, if not suggested,
by <i>Manon Lescaut</i>. And is not the <i>Adam Bede</i> of
George Eliot a variation of Goethe's <i>Faust</i>? Is not
<i>Tess</i> of Thomas Hardy another? And that marvellous
hero Tartarin of Alphonse Daudet: do you
not recognise in him Don Quixote? More than that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
he is a double embodiment, Don Quixote and Sancho
Panza in one: the Don Quixote who dreams of adventures
with lions in the desert, of ascensions on Mont
Blanc, of guns, swords, and alpinstocks, and the Sancho
Panza who thinks of wool socks, flannel vests, and a
medicine-chest for the marvellous journeys that are
going to be undertaken&mdash;a tremendous creation, this
double personage, but not altogether original.</p>

<p>Every character has been described in fiction, every
characteristic of mankind has been told; but we like to
see those characters described again with new surroundings;
we love to hear the philosophy of life told over
again in new, pleasant, pithy, witty sentences.</p>

<p>This lack of originality in literature is so obvious, it
is so well acknowledged a fact that authors, novelists,
or philosophers have used mankind for their work, and
availed themselves of all that mankind has written or
said before, that the law does not allow the literary
man to own the work of his brain for ever and ever, as
he owns land or any other valuable possession. After
allowing him to derive a benefit for forty or fifty years,
his literary productions become common property&mdash;that
is to say, return to mankind to whom he owed so much
of them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>PLAGIARISM</h3>


<p>La Bruy&egrave;re said: 'Women often love liberty only to
abuse it.' Two hundred years later Balzac wrote:
'There are women who crave for liberty in order to
make bad use of it.' The thoughts are not great, they
are not even true, but that is not the question. Could
such a genius as Balzac be accused of plagiarism because
he expressed a thought practically in the very words
of La Bruy&egrave;re? I would as soon charge Balzac with
plagiarism as I would accuse a Vanderbilt or a Carnegie
of trying to cheat a street-car conductor out of a
penny fare. The heroines of <i>Tess</i> and <i>Adam Bede</i>
practically go through the same ordeals as Gretchen.
Would you seriously accuse Thomas Hardy and George
Eliot of plagiarism, and say that they owed their plots
to Goethe's '<i>Faust</i>'?</p>

<p>There are people engaged in literary pursuits, or,
rather, in the literary trade, and, as a rule, not very
successful at that, who spend their leisure time in trying
to catch successful men in the act of committing
plagiarism. The moment they can discover in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
works a sentence that they can compare to a sentence
written by some other author, they put the two sentences
side by side and send them to the papers. There are
papers always ready to publish that sort of thing. Of
course, respectable papers throw those communications
into the waste-paper baskets. Then, when the papers
have published the would-be plagiarism, the perpetrator
marks it in blue pencil at the four corners and
sends it to the author&mdash;anonymously, of course. For
that matter, whenever there appears anything nasty
about a successful man in the papers&mdash;an adverse
criticism or a scurrilous paragraph&mdash;he never runs the
slightest risk of not seeing it; there are scores of
failures, of crabbed, jealous, penurious nobodies who
mail it to him. It does him no harm; but it does
them good.</p>

<p>As far as I can recollect I have, during my twenty-one
years of literary life, committed plagiarism four
times: twice quite unintentionally, once through the
inadvertence of a compositor, and once absolutely out
of mere wickedness, just to draw out the plagiarism
hunter. And I will tell you how it happened. Once,
many years ago, I was reading a book on the French,
written by an American. A phrase struck me as expressing
a sentiment so true, so well observed, that
I memorized it, and, unfortunately, when, several years
later, I wrote a series of articles on France for a London
paper, I incorporated the phrase. I was not long in
being discovered. The author of the book, which had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
never sold, wrote to all the papers that I had 'stolen
his book,' and thought the correspondence would start
a sale for his book. Of course I was guilty, and I
apologized, explaining how it had happened. For years
the phrase had been in my mind&mdash;had, as it were, become
part and parcel of myself. May this be a warning to
authors who may take too great a fancy to a thought
of theirs well expressed by some other author. It is
a very dangerous practice. Another time I incorporated
in a newspaper article a quotation from Emerson, but
the compositor omitted the inverted commas, and
Emerson's sentence read as if it was mine. Of course,
no one would accuse me of choosing Emerson to
plagiarize in America, but this article brought me
half a dozen anonymous letters. In one of them
there was this choice bit: 'The second half of the
article is by Emerson; the first half I don't know,
but probably not by the author.' Twenty centuries of
Christianity have caused Christians to love one another.
But when I really had a good time was when, deliberately,
as I said before, out of sheer wickedness, I introduced
into my text nine lines of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>I have kept the newspapers that commented on it
and the anonymous letters that were mailed to me.
One of them had humour in it. 'My dear sir,' said
the writer, 'when you speak of an incident as being
a personal reminiscence, it is a mistake to borrow it
of an author so widely known for the last three centuries
as the late William Shakespeare.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>A celebrated literary friend of mine once amused
himself in incorporating twenty lines of Dickens as his
own in the midst of an essay he published in his own
paper.</p>

<p>When he feels dull, he takes from his shelves a scrapbook
which contains the letters and newspaper cuttings
referring to the subject.</p>

<p>When a literary man has a reputation of long standing,
never for a moment accuse him of plagiarism. He
may express a thought already expressed by someone
else; he may work out a plot which is not original;
but success that lasts rests on some personal merit. I
have never heard successful men charge any of their
brethren of the pen with plagiarism. Successful men
are charitable to their craft, as beautiful women are to
their sex.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>AUTOBIOGRAPHIES AND REMINISCENCES</h3>


<p>The best writers of memoirs have been the French, and
it is through those memoirs that we know so well and
so intimately the reigns of Louis XIV., Louis XV.,
and Napoleon I., as well as the history of the Revolution,
the Restoration, and the Second Empire.</p>

<p>Courtiers, diplomatists, statesmen, and women of the
Court, by their memoirs and letters, have made us
acquainted not only with the public life of Sovereigns,
but with all the details of their private life, with all the
Court gossip.</p>

<p>The French, however, care little or nothing for
memoirs that do not make clear to them some chapter
of history.</p>

<p>The English, on the contrary, have practically no
memoirs of that sort. The only interesting ones that
I know are those of Greville. On the other hand,
almost every man of note, literary man, journalist,
artist, actor, publishes his autobiography or his
reminiscences.</p>

<p>While the French only care for the work that a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
before the public has produced, the English like to
know how he lived, how he worked, whom he met,
whom he knew, and his appreciation of the character of
his more or less famous friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p>Why, even the music-hall star publishes his reminiscences
in England. The fact is that, if a man keeps
his diary regularly, and knows how to tell an anecdote
well, he can always write a readable book of reminiscences.</p>

<p>Among the best books of this sort that I know I
would mention those of the late Edmund Yates and
George Augustus Sala; but the best of all is the one
which I do hope will make its appearance one day
(although I am not aware that it is being prepared),
and will be signed by the wittiest raconteur and causeur
of England, Mr. Henry Labouchere.</p>

<p>Try to get Mr. Labouchere in one corner of the
smoke-room in the House of Commons, give him a cup
of coffee and some good cigarettes, and just turn him
on; there is no better treat, no more intellectual feast
of mirth and humour and wit in store for you. His
style is the very one suited for a crisp, gossipy, brilliant
book of reminiscences.</p>

<p>Among possible writers of interesting and piquant
memoirs or reminiscences I ought to mention Lady
Dorothy Nevil and Lady Jeune. Both ladies have
known in intimacy every celebrity you wish to name&mdash;Kings,
Queens, statesmen, generals, prelates, judges,
politicians, literary men, artists, lawyers, actors; there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
is not a man or woman of fame who has not supplied
an impression or an incident to them.</p>

<p>And they are the very women to write memoirs,
both possessed of keen judgment and insight in human
nature, and of great literary ability, both delightful
conversationalists, always capable of drawing you out
and enabling you to do your best, and thus supplying
them with materials for notes and observations.</p>

<p>I am not announcing any book, for neither of these
two ladies ever mentioned to me that she was preparing
a book of memoirs, but I wish they would, and I have
simply named them as being both capable of writing
books of unsurpassed interest.</p>

<p>In order to write a good and trustworthy book of
reminiscences, you must, above all, be an observer and
a listener, besides a good story-teller. You must be
modest enough to know how to efface yourself, remain
hidden behind the scenes, and put all your personages
on the stage without hardly appearing yourself.</p>

<p>You must be satisfied with sharing the honours of
the book with all your <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>, and not cause
the printing of the volume to be stopped for want of a
sufficient supply of 'I's' and 'me's.'</p>

<p>I knew a famous actor whose reminiscences were
published some years ago by a literary man. Once I
congratulated that actor on the success of the book.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, 'the book has done me good, because
X., you know, mentions my name once or twice in that
book.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>And many books of reminiscences that I know are
full of the sayings and doings of the author, with an
occasional mention of people of whom we should like to
hear a great deal.</p>

<p>I have met these men in private, and sometimes found
them clever, and invariably fatiguing bores, and their
books are not more entertaining than their conversation.
Many of them reminded me of the first visit that
Diderot paid to Voltaire, on which occasion he talked
the great French wit deaf and dumb.</p>

<p>'What do you think of Diderot?' asked a friend of
Voltaire a few days after that visit.</p>

<p>'Well,' replied Voltaire, 'Diderot is a clever fellow,
but he has no talent for dialogue.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>THOUGHTS ON HATS</h3>


<p>The manly man wears his hat slightly inclined on the
right, naturally, without exaggeration, and without
swagger. The braggart wears his right on his ear.
Jolly fellows, destitute of manners, and drunkards, wear
theirs on the back of the head; when far gone, the brim
of the hat touches the neck.</p>

<p>Hypocrites wear theirs over the eyes. Fops wear
their hats inclined on the left. Why? The reason is
simple. Of course, they know that the hat, if inclined,
should be on the right; but, unfortunately for them,
they look at themselves in the glass, where the hat
inclined on the left looks as if it were inclined on the
right. So they wear it on the left, and think they have
done the correct thing.</p>

<p>The very proper man and the prig invariably wear
their hats perfectly straight. The scientific man and
all men of brains put their heads well inside their hats;
the more scientific the mind is, the deeper the head goes
inside the hat.</p>

<p>Fools put on their hats with the help of both hands,
and simply lay them on the top of their heads. I suppose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
they feel that hats are meant to cover the brain,
and they are satisfied, in their modesty and consciousness
of their value, with covering the small quantity
of brains given to them by Nature.</p>

<p>The absent-minded man is recognised by his hat
brushed against the nap, the tidy man by his irreproachably
smooth hat, and the needy man by a greasy
hat.</p>

<p>A shabby coat is not necessarily a sign that a man is
hard up. Many men get so fond of a coat that they
cannot make up their minds to part with it and discard
it; but shoes down at heel and a shabby, greasy hat
prove that their wearer is drowning: he is helpless and
hopeless.</p>

<p>Only the well-off man, who serves nobody, wears a
white top-hat; this hat is the emblem of independence
and of success in life.</p>

<p>Man's station in life is shown from the way he takes
off his hat. Kings and emperors just lift it off their
heads. A gentleman takes off his hat to whoever
salutes him. Once a beggar in Dublin saluted the
great Irish patriot, Daniel O'Connell. The latter returned
the salute by taking off his hat to the beggar.</p>

<p>'How can you take off your hat to a beggar?' remarked
a friend who was with him. 'Because,' he
replied, 'I don't want that beggar to say that he is
more of a gentleman than I am.' Parvenus keep their
hats on always, unless before some aristocrat, to whom
they cringe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>The Englishman takes off his hat with a stiff jerk
and puts it on again immediately. The Frenchman
takes it off gently, and, before a lady, remains uncovered
until she says to him: 'Couvrez-vous, monsieur,
je vous prie.'</p>

<p>The Italian takes it off with ceremony, and with his
hand puts it nearly to the ground. Timid men keep
rolling their hats in their hands. Very religious ones
pray inside them, making a wry face, as if the emanations
were of an unpleasant character.</p>

<p>Soldiers and horsemen fix their hats by pressing on
the top of the crown.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Men who belong to decent clubs and frequent 'at
homes' never need be in want of a good hat.</p>

<p>In Paris, in London, and in New York during the
season no gentleman can wear anything but a silk hat
after lunch-time.</p>

<p>When you pay calls, you must enter the drawing-room
with your hat in your hand and keep it all the
time, unless you are on very intimate terms with your
host and hostess, when you may leave it in the hall.</p>

<p>A well-put-on hat is the proof of a well-balanced
mind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>THOUGHTS ON EYE-GLASSES</h3>


<p>The man who wears spectacles&mdash;I mean eye-glasses with
branches fixed behind the ears&mdash;is a serious man, a man
of science, a man of business&mdash;at all events, a man who
thinks of his comfort before he thinks of his appearance.
There is no nonsense, no frivolity about him, especially
if they are framed in gold. He is a steady man, somewhat
prosaic, and even matter-of-fact. If he is a young
man and wears them, you may conclude that he means
to succeed, and always look on the serious side of life.
He is no fop, no lady-killer, but a man whose affections
can be relied on, and who expects a woman to love him
for the qualities of his mind and the truthfulness of his
heart.</p>

<p>Next to a solid gold watch and chain, a pair of gold
spectacles are the best testimony of respectability; then
comes a sound umbrella.</p>

<p>The man who wears his eye-glasses halfway down his
nose is a shrewd man of business, who ever bears in mind
that time is money. Thus placed, his eye-glasses enable
him to read a letter of introduction, and, above them,
to read and observe the character of the person who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
has presented it to him. Lawyers generally wear them
that way, and they seldom fail to have their bureau so
placed that they can have their backs to the window,
while their clients or callers are seated opposite in the
full light of the day.</p>

<p>Old gentlemen wear their eye-glasses on the tip of
their noses when they read their newspaper, because it
enables them to recline in their arm-chairs and assume
a more comfortable position.</p>

<p>The single eye-glass was originally worn by people
whose eyes were different, in order to remedy the defective
one. To-day it may be asserted that, out of a
hundred men who wear single eye-glasses, ninety-nine
see through&mdash;the other one. The single eye-glass is
tolerable in a man of a certain age who is both clever
and <i>distingu&eacute;</i> looking. John Bright, with his fine
white mass of hair and intelligent, firm, yet kind expression,
looked beautiful with his eye-glass on. Lord
Beaconsfield also looked well with one. To Mr.
Joseph Chamberlain, with his turned-up nose and
sneering smile, and his jaw ever ready to snap, it adds
impudence.</p>

<p>When a man looks silly, the single eye-glass finishes
him and makes him look like a drivelling idiot. If,
besides, he is very young, it gives you an irresistible
desire to smack his face or pull his nose.</p>

<p>The single eye-glass originated in England, but it is
now worn in France quite as much, especially by young
dudes, who, lacking the manliness of young Englishmen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
look preposterously ridiculous with them on. I must
say, however, that great Frenchmen have worn single
eye-glasses, among them Alphonse Daudet, Aur&eacute;lien
Scholl, President Felix Faure, Gaston Paris. Alfred
Capus, now our most popular dramatist, wears one; so
does Paul Bourget, but the latter is short-sighted on
the right side.</p>

<p>No Royalty has ever been known to wear one, although
not long ago I saw a portrait of the Kaiser with a single
eye-glass.</p>

<p>America is to be congratulated on the absence of
single eye-glasses. I may have seen one or two at the
horse-show in New York, but I should not like to swear
to it. An American dude, with his trousers turned up,
wearing a single eye-glass and sucking the top of his
stick, would be a sight for the gods to enjoy. I believe
that a single eye-glass, not only in Chicago or Kansas
City, but in Broadway, New York, and even in Boston,
would cause Americans, whose bump of veneration is
not highly developed, to pass remarks not of a particularly
favourable character on its wearer. In the West,
he might be tarred and feathered, if not lynched. One
way or the other, he would be a success there.</p>

<p>But the most impudent, the most provoking single
eye-glass of all is the one which is worn, generally by
very young men, without strings. As they frown and
wink, and make the grimace unavoidable to the wearer
of that kind of apparel, they seem to say: 'See what
practice can do! I have no string, yet I am not at all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
afraid of my glass falling from my eye.' Rich Annamites
grow their finger-nails eight and ten inches long,
to show you that they are aristocrats, and have never
used their hands for any kind of work. French and
English parasites advertise their uselessness by this
exhibition of the single eye-glass without string. And
with it on, they eat, talk, smoke, run, laugh, and sneeze&mdash;and
it sticks. Wonderful, simply wonderful! When
you can do that, you really are 'in it.'</p>

<p>When you consider the progress that civilization is
making every day, the discoveries that are made, the
pluck and perseverance that are shown by the pioneers
of all science, by the princes of commerce, by the
explorers of new fields and pastures, in your gratitude
for all they have done and are still doing for the world,
you must not forget the well-groomed young man who
has succeeded in being able to wear a single eye-glass
without a string.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>THOUGHTS ON UMBRELLAS</h3>


<p>Tell me how a man uses his umbrella, and I will tell
you his character.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon Puritan always carried his umbrella
open. If he rolled it, you might, at a distance, take
that umbrella for a stick, which, he thinks, would give
him a certain fast appearance. The miser does the
same, because an umbrella that is never rolled lasts
longer.</p>

<p>The man who always takes an umbrella out with
him is a cautious individual, who never runs risks, and
abstains from speculation. He will probably die rich;
at all events, in cosy circumstances. On the contrary,
the man who always leaves his umbrella behind him is
generally one who makes no provision for the morrow.
That man is thoughtless, reckless, always late for the
train or an appointment, leaves the street-door open
when he comes home late at night, and is generally
unreliable.</p>

<p>The man who is always losing his umbrella is an
unlucky dog, whose bills are protested, whose boots
split, whose gloves crack, whose buttons are always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
coming off, who is always in trouble on account of one
thing or another.</p>

<p>The man, who leaves a new umbrella in his club and
hopes to find it there the following day, is a simpleton
who deserves all the bad luck that pursues him through
life.</p>

<p>The man who comes early to an 'at home' may not
show his eagerness to present his respects to a hostess
early so much as to aim at having a better chance to
choose a good umbrella.</p>

<p>The man who is perpetually showing a nervous
anxiety about his umbrella, and wondering if it is safe,
is full of meanness and low suspicion. Let him be ever
so rich, if he asks your daughter in marriage, refuse her
to him. He will undoubtedly take more care of his
umbrella than of his wife.</p>

<p>If you are fortunate enough to have your umbrella
when it rains, and you meet a friend who has left his
at home, and asks you to shelter him, try immediately
to meet another friend or acquaintance to whom you
will offer the same service. By so doing, you will be all
right in the middle, you will have your sides also well
protected, and, besides, you will have obliged two
friends instead of one.</p>

<p>The possession of a well-regulated watch and a decent
umbrella is to a great degree a sign of respectability.
More watches and silk umbrellas are pawned than all
the other pieces of man's apparel put together.</p>

<p>The man who carries a cotton umbrella is either a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
philosopher, who defies the world and all its fashionable
conventions and prejudices, or an economist, who knows
that a cotton umbrella is cheaper than a silk one, and
lasts longer.</p>

<p>The man who walks with short, jerky steps, and
never allows his umbrella to touch the ground, is
a very proper man, and not uncommonly a downright
hypocrite. On the other hand, the man who walks
with a firm, long step, swinging his body slightly
from right to left, and using his umbrella like a stick,
is generally a good, manly fellow.</p>

<p>Once a man came to an afternoon 'at home,' and,
when ready to leave the house, could not find his
umbrella, a beautiful new one. He made somewhat
of a fuss in the hall. The master of the house came to
his rescue, and looked for the missing umbrella among
the scores that were there.</p>

<p>'Are you sure you had an umbrella when you
came?'</p>

<p>'Quite sure.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps you left it at the other party, where you
went first.'</p>

<p>'No, no; that's where I got it.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>SOME AMERICAN TOPICS</h3>


<p>As I sit quietly thinking over my seventh visit to the
United States, some impressions take a definite shape.
I may here repeat a phrase which I used yesterday
while speaking to the representative of an English newspaper
who had called to interview me:</p>

<p>'This last visit has left me more than ever impressed
with the colossal greatness of the American
people.'</p>

<p>The progress they have made during the last five
years is perfectly astounding&mdash;progress in commerce
and industry, progress in art and science, progress in
architecture. The whole thing is simply amazing. And
the ingenuity displayed in the smallest things!</p>

<p>Really, this morning I was pitying from the bottom
of my heart a poor English carman, who was emptying
sacks of coal into a hole made in the pavement, as in
New York, in front of a house.</p>

<p>He had to go and fetch every sack of coal, put it on
his back, carry it with his bent body, and then aim at
the hole as best he could. In New York the cart is
lifted one side by means of a handle, an inclined tray is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
placed at the bottom of the cart, with its head over the
hole, and down goes the coal as the man looks at the
work done for him.</p>

<p>It is in thousands of little things like this that you
understand how the American mind is constantly at
work. I do not know whether America makes more
inventions than other nations (I believe that France is
still leading), but there is no country where so many
inventions are perfected.</p>

<p>In a great measure I attribute the commercial prosperity
of the Americans to the soundness and practicability
of their principles in the matter of the commercial
education of their youth. It is partly due to
the existence of the 'business college,' which has no
counterpart in England, but which is as great and
powerful an institution in the States as public schools
are in England. Until Europe has such colleges, she
will never breed leaders of commerce and industry as
they are bred in America.</p>

<p>France possesses the best artisans in the world&mdash;glass-cutters,
cabinet-makers, book-binders, gardeners&mdash;simply
because boys of the working classes choose their
trade early, work long apprenticeships, and study.</p>

<p>The English boy of these classes becomes a plumber
at thirteen, then he tries everything afterward. He is
in turn a mason, a gardener, anything you like 'for a
job.' In America it is the mind of boys which is prepared
for commerce in the business colleges. At twenty
they are practical men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, my mind is full of trusts. Is it possible
that in a few years all the great industries of America&mdash;its
mines, its railroads, its telegraphic and telephonic
systems, its land, its land produce&mdash;will all be amalgamated
and transformed into trusts?</p>

<p>I am not inclined to look on this great system of
trusts in too pessimistic a fashion. In my view, they
may eventually lead to the nationalization of those
gigantic enterprises, and in this way bring about the
greatest good for the greatest number, by the simple
reason that it will be much easier for the State to deal
with all those different trusts than with thousands of
different companies and individuals.</p>

<p>One day the earth will belong to its inhabitants, not
to a privileged few. Trusts may lead to the solution
of the question.</p>

<p>Another impression deeply confirmed more than ever:
the English may talk of the 'blood-thicker-than-water'
theory, but it will never stand the test of a
political crisis.</p>

<p>Of course, there are the '400' of New York who are
entirely pro-English, and half apologetic for being
American; but the population of Greater New York
is 4,000,000. If out of 4,000,000 you take 400, there
still remain some Americans. And these have no love
lost for England.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>SOME AMERICANS I OBJECT TO</h3>


<p>An American was one day travelling with an Englishman
friend of mine in the same railway compartment
from Dieppe to Paris. During the conversation, the
American did not care to own that he hailed from
America, but went as far as to confess that he came
from Boston, which, he thought, would no doubt
atone for his being American in the eyes of his English
companion.</p>

<p>'And where are you going to put up in Paris?'
inquired the Englishman. 'Well,' replied the Bostonian,
'I was thinking of staying at Meurice's; but it's so full
of d&mdash;&mdash;d Americans! Where are you going to stop
yourself?' 'H'm,' said the Englishman; 'I was thinking
of stopping at Meurice's myself, but the place is so
full of d&mdash;&mdash;d English people!'</p>

<p>I object to the American who tells you that he
spends the summer in Europe because America does
not possess a summer resort fit to visit, and who regrets
being unable to spend the winter in the South of France
because there is not in the United States a decent place
where to spend the winter months, who assures you that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
America does not possess a single spot historically interesting.
In my innocence I thought that an American
might be interested to visit the Independence Hall of
Philadelphia, Mount Vernon in Virginia, Lexington,
Bunker's Hill, Yorktown, Chattanooga, Gettysburg, and
a few other places where his ancestors made America
what she is now.</p>

<p>I thought that the Hudson River compared favourably
with the Thames and the Seine, the Rocky
Mountains with the Alps and the Pyrenees, the Sierras
with Switzerland, and that Europe had nothing to offer
to be mentioned in the same breath with the Indian
summer of America, when the country puts on her garb
of red and gold.</p>

<p>When you meet that American in Europe, he asks
you if you have met Lord Fitz-Noodle, Lady Ginger,
and the Marquis de la Roche-Trompette. When you
confess to him that you never had the pleasure of meeting
those European worthies, he throws at you a patronizing
glance, a mixture of pity and contempt, which
seems to say: 'Good gracious! who on earth can you
be? In what awful set do you move?'</p>

<p>At fashionable places, on board steamers, he avoids
his compatriots and introduces himself into the aristocracy,
always glad to patronize people who have
money. He makes no inquiry about the private character
of those titled people before he allows his wife
and daughters to frequent them. They are titled, and,
in his eyes, that sanctifies everything. On board a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
steamer he works hard with the purser and the chief
steward in order to be given a seat at the same table
with a travelling lord. You never see him in anybody
else's company.</p>

<p>A favourite remark of his is: 'The Americans one
meets in Europe make me feel ashamed of my country
and of my compatriots.'</p>

<p>How I do prefer to that American snob the good
American who has never left the States, and who is
perfectly convinced that America is the only country
fit for a free man to live in&mdash;God's own country! At
any rate, he is a good patriot, proud of his motherland.
I even prefer to him that American (often to be met
abroad) who damns everything in Europe; who prefers
the Presbyterian church of his little city to Notre Dame,
Westminster Abbey, and the cathedrals of Rouen,
Cologne, and Milan; who thinks that England is such
a tight little island that he is afraid of going out at
night for fear of falling into the water; who thinks
that French politeness and manners are much overrated,
and who, when being asked if he likes French
cuisine, replies: 'No; nor their cookery either.'</p>

<p>I love the man who sees only things to admire in his
mother and his own country; and in America that man
has his choice&mdash;<i>une abondance de biens</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>PATIENCE&mdash;AN AMERICAN TRAIT</h3>


<p>For power of endurance, give me the Americans. They
are angels of patience. The best illustration is what
they can put up with at their Custom House when they
return home. Foreigners are more leniently dealt with,
but if the American and his wife return from a trip to
Europe and have with them twelve trunks and ten
bags, these twelve trunks and ten bags have to be
opened and thoroughly searched, and that although
the said American has already signed a paper that he
has nothing dutiable with him.</p>

<p>In every civilized nation of the world, there is a
Custom House officer to inquire of the foreign visitor
or the returning native whether he has anything to
declare. He is not required to sign anything. He is
asked the question on presenting himself with his
baggage.</p>

<p>Never more than one piece of luggage is opened, and
when the owner is a lady alone she is allowed to pass
without having anything opened, unless, of course, she
appears to be a suspicious character.</p>

<p>Everywhere in Europe any decent-looking man or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
woman who declares that he or she has nothing dutiable
has one piece of luggage examined and no more.
But in America not only is every trunk, every bag,
opened, but everything in it most searchingly examined.</p>

<p>'Have you worn this?' says the man.</p>

<p>I knew a gentleman who had had ten trunks examined
from top to bottom, but could not find the key to his
hat-box, a light piece of luggage which, by its weight,
was labelled innocent. The Custom House officer took
a hatchet and smashed it.</p>

<p>I allowed myself to be told that the gentleman in
question could obtain no redress against the man in
authority. A lady, for that matter, would have been
treated in exactly the same way. No respect for her
sex, no consideration for the pretty things she had had
so carefully packed; everything is taken out, felt, and
replaced topsy-turvy.</p>

<p>When a favourite steamer arrives in New York, with
500 first and second class passengers, it means about
5,000 pieces of luggage to open and examine. If you
have no servants to see it done for you, the odds are
that you will be five hours on the wharf before you are
able to proceed to your hotel.</p>

<p>The Americans grumble, but patiently endure the
nuisance, as if they were not masters in their own home
and able to put a stop to it. No Englishman would
stand it a day. If it was a special order, it would be
repealed at once. The only time when the thing was
done in England was during the period of scare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
produced by the Irish dynamitards some twenty-five years
ago.</p>

<p>To some American millionairesses fifty new dresses
are less extravagant than two or three for other women;
besides, if they are extravagant, that's their business.
What does it matter so long as it is not some materials
for sale or any other commercial purpose?</p>

<p>The Americans endure bureaucracy much more readily
than the English. In that, as in many other traits, they
more resemble the French, who, in spite of their reputation
for being unruly, are the most docile, enduring,
easily-governed people in the world, until they are
aroused, when&mdash;then look out!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>AMERICAN FEELINGS FOR FOREIGNERS</h3>


<p>Jonathan has such a large family of his own to think
of and look after at home that he has not much time to
spare for concerning himself about what is going on in
other people's houses.</p>

<p>He takes a general interest in them, likes to be
kept acquainted with what is happening in the world,
in Europe especially; he feels sympathy for most
people, antipathy to one, but it would be difficult to
say, so far as the names of the American people are
concerned, that he has a predilection for any particular
nation more than for any other.</p>

<p>The largest foreign element in the United States is
German, Scandinavian, and Irish; but they are all now
digested and assimilated, and they inspire no particular
feeling in the breast of Uncle Sam for the respective
countries they originally came from. He asks them to
be, and they are, good American citizens, ready to fight
his battles on election day or, if need be, on the battlefield.</p>

<p>There is no 'most favoured' nation in the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
character, which in this respect is opportunist to the
greatest degree.</p>

<p>During the war with Spain the Americans were pro-English,
because they had the moral support of the
English, or thought they had.</p>

<p>In 1895, during the Venezuelan difficulty, they were
above all anti-English. Just at present their love of
the English is somewhat cooler, because they wonder
whether England was really friendly and sincere during
the Spanish-American War, and because their sympathy
was for the Boers who, in their eyes, rightly or wrongly,
bravely fought for their liberty and independence as
the Americans did 125 years ago.</p>

<p>When Prince Henry visited the United States, the
Americans regarded his visit as a great compliment
paid to their country, and a delicate advance and
attention on the part of the German Emperor.</p>

<p>Then Germany naturally came to the front, and, at
the time, might with reason have been called the nation
nearest to the heart of Jonathan. Prince Henry was
f&ecirc;ted, banqueted, liked, and when the steamer took him
home, he was remembered with pleasure and forgotten,
and Germany resumed her position of foreign nation,
just like that of any other.</p>

<p>The English, who buy inventions, but seldom make
them, are now starting the rumour that the Prince of
Wales has been invited to visit the United States.
The idea is not very original, not any more than that
of King Edward having a racing yacht built in America,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
and sending his son over to be present at its launching
and christening. That sort of thing may be overdone.</p>

<p>If, however, the Prince of Wales went to America, he
would be received with open arms, the 'blood-thicker-than-water'
business, and the 'kin-and-kith' cry would
be indulged in during his visit, after which everything
would resume its normal state.</p>

<p>If the President of the French Republic could be
induced to visit America, the Americans would become
pro-French; Lafayette, the 'never-to-be-forgotten
helper of the Americans' in their struggle for liberty
and independence, would be resurrected, and this visit
would, perhaps, be the one most likely to go straight to
the hearts of the Americans, as, in this case, the visit
paid would bring to the United States the very head of
the French nation and the President of a great Republic,
the sister Republic.</p>

<p>But the visit over, I have no doubt that Jonathan
would resume his business habits, forget all about it,
and only remember a little excitement and a good time.</p>

<p>Let me, however, advise any royalty, English or other,
to wait a little before visiting America. For a long
time there will be no originality, no novelty even, about
the presence of a real Prince in the United States, and
the Americans are particularly fond of novelties. They
want a constant change in the programme.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>SHOULD YOUNG GIRLS READ NOVELS?</h3>


<p>A lady, an intimate friend of the late Alphonse Karr, was
one day on a visit to the famous French author, and
noticing in his library the statuettes of the Venus of
Milo and a few other classical beauties, she said to him:
'I am afraid you are wrong to feast your eyes on those
exquisite faces and perfect forms, because they very
seldom exist in real life, and they can only make you
feel disappointed and spoil your mind. When you go
to a ballroom, I imagine that there are few women, if
any, that you are not inclined to criticise.'</p>

<p>For the same reason I will answer a lady correspondent,
who asks me whether she should encourage or
even allow her daughters to read novels: No, young
people should not read novels. Instead of infusing
into their minds sensible ideas about the stern realities
of life, they portray disinterestedness that is overdone,
beauty that is rarely seen outside of museums, devotion
that has been very uncommon since the days of the
Crusaders, love that has been unheard of since the death
of Orpheus and Eurydice, pluck that died with Bayard
and Bertrand du Guesclin; and I am not sure that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
loathsome as they are to me, I would not recommend
the novels of the realistic school rather than those of
the romantic school to young people of both sexes; for
if the former make you feel fairly disgusted with
humanity, they do not, like the latter, fill the minds of
youth with illusions that are destined to be blown to
the four winds of the earth by the realities of life. In
fact, I know some novels which young people might
read, and also some which they ought to read; but I
believe I could count them all on the fingers of my two
hands. Let young people study life from life, listen to
the experience of those who have lived, frequent people
who have found happiness and met with success in
life. This will much better make them serve their
apprenticeship.</p>

<p>Yes, I say, avoid reading all novels, and, above all,
the sentimental ones&mdash;those that make young girls
believe that husbands are lovers who spend their lives
at the feet of their wives making love to them, and
young men imagine that wives are sweethearts who
have nothing to do but coo and try to look pretty.
Let young people read books that will help make them
sensible and cheerful, books of travels and adventures,
books of pleasant philosophy, of common-sense and
humour. Boyhood, girlhood, as well as young manhood
and womanhood, should be spent in cheerful
surroundings, for nothing leads better to morality than
cheerfulness. If I had a house full of young people, I
would have my house ring all day long with the peals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
of laughter of my boys and girls. Fun of the good,
wholesome sort, humour and gaiety, should be the daily
food of youth, and only books that supply it should be
given to them.</p>

<p>On the whole, there is not much to choose between
the novels of the realistic school, that would
make you believe that the world is full of murderers,
forgers, men and women with diseased minds, novels
that reek of disinfectants, and make you feel as you do
when you come out of a hospital and your clothes are
permeated with a smell of carbolic acid, and the novels
of the sentimental school, that would lead you to
believe that all the male and female geese who are their
heroes and heroines have the slightest chance of being
successful in life.</p>

<p>People should already know a great deal of real life
before they get acquainted with the way in which it is
represented in novels.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>NOW, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH FATHER?</h3>


<p>I confess that I am a little tired, and I will say so
frankly, of continually hearing such phrases as 'What
is home without a mother?' 'God bless our mother!'
and so forth. I should like to use an Americanism and
ask, 'Now, pray, what's the matter with father?'</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that children would grow just
as sensible if they sometimes heard a word of praise
bestowed on their fathers instead of being loaded with
an endless litany of all the virtues of mother.</p>

<p>Mother's love, mother's devotion, mother's influence,
mother's this, and mother's that. Now, father does
exist, and occasionally makes himself useful enough to
stand in no need of an apology for daring to exist.</p>

<p>He generally loves his children, and sometimes feels
that he cannot compete with his wife in their affections,
simply because she monopolizes them, not only
when they are babies, but after they are out of infancy.
He resents it, but, as a rule, resigns himself to what he
is made to believe inevitable.</p>

<p>The first duty of a woman is to teach her children to
love their father, and, as they grow up, to teach them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
to respect him and admire him. It is her duty to hide
from her children any little thing that might cause
them to lose the least respect or admiration towards
him.</p>

<p>But, out of one hundred women, will you find one
who will not be of opinion that mother is foremost?</p>

<p>When a woman has become a mother, her vanity,
though often full of repose, gets the best of her. She
is a mother, and thinks she is the most important thing
in the world. Yet, as I say elsewhere, it is no extraordinary
testimonial for a woman to be fond of her
children. All mothers are fond of their children and
good to them&mdash;why, even the fiercest and cruellest of
animals. The feeling is given to them by Nature. We
all profit by it; we are all happier for it. For being able
to dispense maternal love woman is to be admired and
blessed, but not congratulated. A child is part and
parcel of a mother. In loving a child a woman loves
part of herself. It is not selfishness so much as self-love.
When she brings up her children for herself, for
the love of herself, without doing her utmost to see that
their father gets his share; when, thanks to her own
trumpeting, her house rings only with 'God bless our
mother!' she is guilty of an act of terrible injustice.</p>

<p>The vanity of some women is such that some expect
a pedestal&mdash;nay, an altar&mdash;when the spring-cleaning of
their house is over.</p>

<p>I know men who work with one view only&mdash;that of
bringing up their children in comfort, giving them a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
University education, and starting them in life at the
cost of any sacrifice.</p>

<p>I know Americans who work like slaves at home so
that their wives and daughters may enjoy themselves
in Paris and London. For this they demand
nothing except an occasional letter, which they sometimes
get.</p>

<p>Mother is very tired! She has had to pay calls, go
to so many 'at homes,' so many garden-parties! She is
exhausted; she wants a change of air immediately.
Father is at his office, a dingy, badly-ventilated room.
He has had no holiday for a year. He, too, would like
a little change of air; but what's the matter with
father? He's all right.</p>

<p>In the most humble stations of life we have all of us
known that man who gets up at five o'clock in the
morning, lights the fire to cook a bit of breakfast for
himself, gets his tools and starts to his daily labour,
wiping off the dew of the dawn on his boots while many
a mother is sleeping. With his hard-earned wages he
pays the butcher, the grocer, the milkman and the
baker. He stands off the wolf and the bailiff and pays
the rent.</p>

<p>What's the matter with father? How blessed that
home would be without him!</p>

<p>I know there are loafers who refuse the work that
would enable them to support their wives and children.
There are also good steady workmen who at home find
nothing awaiting them except the sight of a drunken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
woman, who not only has not prepared a meal for him,
but has spent his hard-earned money, and not uncommonly
even pawned the baby's shoes to get brandy or
gin with. 'What's home without a mother?' 'God
bless our mother!'</p>

<p>Do give father a chance, if you please.</p>

<p>'We have no doubt a great many people will enjoy the book, and the enjoyment will
be innocent and wholesome.'&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

<p>'Max O'Rell's chaff is excellent, and all in perfect good taste.'&mdash;<i>Pelican.</i></p>

<p>'The genial author takes up the cudgels on behalf of the better-looking sex in a way
which should make his book tremendously popular with lady readers&mdash;especially the
married ones.... A very entertaining book.'&mdash;<i>Golden Penny.</i></p>

<p>'Contains some delightful reading.... It is a book happy in idea, felicitous in
expression, cynically frank and refreshing in its candour.'&mdash;<i>Gossip.</i></p>

<p>'Another collection of amusing and epigrammatic essays.... Max O'Rell, as everyone
knows, has the gift of discoursing fluently and amusingly on any subject on which he
touches, and to English and American people his good-humoured criticisms are particularly
valuable, as they are not only sound and sane in themselves, but they are written
from an outside standpoint.'&mdash;<i>Morning Leader.</i></p>

<p>'Women will not feel sorry that Max O'Rell's last work should be his new book on
the fair sex. For many a year he has helped us with his gentle raillery, cheered us with
his bright humour, and taught us much. "Rambles in Womanland" contains many little
personal reminiscences and revelations, and its author's wit is undimmed. The book
is full of epigrams, bons mots, and piquant criticisms.'&mdash;<i>Gentlewoman.</i></p>

<p>'Max O'Rell's last book will add to the regret that his genial pen will write no more.
Usually there is a tone of gaiety in what he says, but at all times he discusses important
problems with all seriousness, and with not a little of the wisdom with which a wide
knowledge of the world had endowed him. Max O'Rell's writings have always been
notable for witty epigrammatic sentences.... His last work is a bright and engaging
book.'&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>'With a pretty wit and a turn for epigram this writer can scarcely be dull, and no
one will turn to one or other of these chatty chapters without being pleasantly entertained.'&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>'Liveliness, amiability, charm, honourable sentiment, humour, every quality that the
best kind of French culture produces, are open to anyone who can read English in the
pages of Max O'Rell. Every page of these "Rambles" is sprinkled over with aphorisms.
... This most entertaining book.'&mdash;<i>Vanity Fair.</i></p>

<p>'There is much that is entertaining in these short pithy comments on women's characteristics,
and occasionally criticism that penetrates deep beneath the surface, and reveals
a vast amount of observation and knowledge of the world.... The book is full of smart
sayings and clever aphorisms.'&mdash;<i>Publishers' Circular.</i></p>

<p>'Whatever his theme, he is always bright, and the coruscations of his wit are exceedingly
diverting.... This last contribution is full of good things, placed in an amusing
setting.... These are but a few maxims culled from a crowded garden.... This
wonderful little volume.'&mdash;<i>Echo.</i></p>

<p>'"Rambles in Womanland" has between its covers much wisdom, served up with
a pretty garnish of wit and that wholesome sauce&mdash;common sense. Indeed, Max O'Rell
has written nothing better than&mdash;in fact, nothing so good as&mdash;"Rambles in Womanland."
Here we have his riper wisdom, his fuller experience; but while he has gained in wisdom
or experience, he has not lost his spiciness or his power of brief, terse epigram.'&mdash;<i>Black
and White.</i></p>

<p>'Full of sparkling common-sense.'&mdash;<i>T. P.'s Weekly.</i></p>

<p>'There is enough fresh material to commend these "Rambles in Womanland" to those
who have enjoyed rambling through the author's entertaining writings.'&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
